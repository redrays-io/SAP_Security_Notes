**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 1  
**Recency:** New  
**Released On:** May 8, 2012  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** Customer Relationship Management > CRM Analytics > CRM Analytics Business Objects > CRM Analytics Business Objects UI

### Symptom
CRM-ANA-BOJ-UI can be exploited by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability can potentially allow the attacker to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The BSP Pages, specifically `GS_ANA_FAV_REP` within CRM-ANA-BOJ-UI, do not adequately encode OUTPUT parameters. This oversight results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, enabling attackers to steal users' authentication data. If an administrator's account is compromised, it could lead to a complete security breach of the application.
