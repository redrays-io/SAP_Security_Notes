**Title:** Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BTF-Editor

---

#### Symptom

The BTF-Editor can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Reason and Prerequisites

The BTF-Editor does not sufficiently encode input/output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a website and steal authentication information such as session data. A malicious user who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

#### Solution

To resolve the cross-site scripting issue in the BTF-Editor, install the relevant support package or implement the correction instructions listed in this note.
