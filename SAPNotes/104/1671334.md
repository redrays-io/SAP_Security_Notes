1671334 - Security: XSS vulnerability in SAP GUI for HTML

**Description**

SAP Security Note **1671334** addresses a critical Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in **SAP GUI for HTML** within the **PA-PA-IN** services. This vulnerability allows a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Symptom**

- Unauthorized modification of application content.
- Potential theft of authentication information from legitimate users.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The vulnerability arises because ITS Services (HRESSIN_F16, PZ80, PZ88) within **PA-PA-IN** do not sufficiently encode output parameters. This lack of proper encoding results in a cross-site scripting issue, which can be exploited to steal user authentication data. If an administrator's account is compromised, the security of the entire application may be fully breached.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Import the relevant support package** that includes the necessary security fixes.
2. **Perform manual corrections** as detailed in the attached document [security_manual_instructions.pdf](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012006153200000019522012&iv_version=0002&iv_guid=71FE4D3FD943A945A3376BE4A89621AE).

**Note:** The effectiveness of these corrections depends on the implementation of [SAP Note 1621946](https://me.sap.com/notes/1621946) and [SAP Note 1488500](https://me.sap.com/notes/1488500). Ensure both are applied to fully secure the system.
