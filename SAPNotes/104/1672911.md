### Description

#### Symptom
BC-SRV-NBC ("Netweaver Business Content") contains code that changes the program's behavior when a user is successfully authenticated with a certain user name. An attacker can be authenticated there without having their own legitimate credentials, or they may escalate privileges.

#### Other Terms
Hard-coded, credentials, BC-SRV-NBC ("Netweaver Business Content")

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The program code contains a hard-coded user name that changes the system's behavior if a user is successfully authenticated. The user may obtain additional information that should not be displayed.  
The vulnerability is caused by a hard-coded user name and password combination in the program's source code. An attacker who specifies these credentials can log on to the system without having been assigned legitimate access by the system administrator(s).  
If a user already has privileges with which they can log on, an escalation of privileges may be possible if the hard-coded account has higher access rights than the original user.

#### Solution
Implement this note.
