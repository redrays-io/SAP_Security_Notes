1672569 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in CRM-ISA

**SAP Security Note 1672569 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in CRM-ISA**

**Symptom:**
An attacker can exploit CRM-ISA to modify application content without authorization, persist these changes, and potentially steal authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Impact:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Allows attackers to embed malicious content that executes automatically when users access the affected web application.
- **Authentication Information Theft:** Attackers can steal users' authentication data, enabling them to impersonate users, including administrators, which can lead to a full compromise of the application's security.

**Solution:**
Apply the support package patch attached to this SAP Note. For detailed instructions on applying Java patches, refer to [SAP Note 877887](https://me.sap.com/notes/877887). Additionally, consult [SAP Note 1546959](https://me.sap.com/notes/1546959) for information on the patching strategy.
