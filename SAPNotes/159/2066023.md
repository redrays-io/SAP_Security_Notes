SAP Note 2066023 - Switchable Authorization Checks for RFC in SD

---

**Overview**

SAP Note 2066023 introduces switchable authorization checks for RFC function modules within the Sales and Distribution (SD) module, specifically targeting Price Catalog Outbound processes. This enhancement strengthens security by implementing additional authorization validations beyond the standard `S_RFC` object.

**Symptom**

The standard `S_RFC` authorization checks may not adequately secure certain RFC function modules used in Price Catalog Outbound, potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions through these RFC calls.

**Solution**

The note provides new switchable authorization checks, which are initially inactive to maintain system compatibility. Administrators need to manually activate these checks using transaction `SACF` by following the detailed instructions outlined in the note.

**Implementation Steps**

1. **Download and Apply the Support Package**
   - [Download for SNOTE](https://notesdownloads.sap.com/note/0040000012277692017)

2. **Activate Switchable Authorization Checks**
   - Follow the **Manual Activities** section in the note to upload authorization scenario definitions via transaction `SACF`.
   - Create productive authorization scenarios and activate them in either "Active" or "Logging" mode.
