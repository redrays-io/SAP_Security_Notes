**Release Date:** November 30, 2018  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Component:** Financials > Financial Supply Chain Management > Dispute Management  

### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functions of SAP Dispute Management to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### Reason and Prerequisites
SAP Dispute Management while editing a dispute case does not contain required checks against a positive set of allowed functions (i.e., whitelist) during execution of these functions. This is required to verify that authenticated users are allowed to access these functions. The missing check may result in undesired system behavior.

### Solution
Implement the correction instructions provided in the SAP Security Note.
