2063369 - Potential remote code execution in profile maintenance

**Symptom**

An attacker can exploit functions of profile maintenance to enable them to take complete control of the product, including viewing, changing, or deleting data.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 7.5 / 10
- **CVSS Base Vector:**
  | Metric                         | Value     |
  |--------------------------------|-----------|
  | Attack Vector (AV)             | Network (N) |
  | Attack Complexity (AC)         | Medium (M)  |
  | Authentication (Au)            | Single (S)  |
  | Impact to Confidentiality (C)  | Partial (P) |
  | Impact to Integrity (I)        | Partial (P) |
  | Impact to Availability (A)     | Complete (C) |

**Other Terms**

Buffer overflow, RCE, remote code execution, BC-CCM-CNF-PFL

**Reason and Prerequisites**

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in profile maintenance. This enables an attacker to inject code into the working memory that is subsequently executed by the application. It can also be used to cause a general fault in the product, causing the product to terminate.

**Solution**

The kernel now validates null pointer exceptions. Please apply the Support Package mentioned in this SAP Note for `disp+work.exe`.
