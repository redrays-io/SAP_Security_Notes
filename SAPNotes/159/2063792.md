2063792 - Missing authorization check in LO-AB

**Description**

An authenticated user can use functions of **LO-AB** to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Symptom**

LO-AB does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access certain functions. This lack of checks may lead to undesired system behavior, allowing users to perform actions beyond their intended permissions.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The absence of authorization checks in LO-AB means that authenticated users can access and utilize functions without proper authorization verification. This oversight can potentially lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation within the system.

**Solution**

The affected function modules in LO-AB do not require RFC enabling. As a corrective measure, this option will be disabled to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that proper authorization checks are enforced.
