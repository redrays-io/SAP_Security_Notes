SAP Security Note 2062186 - Switchable authorization checks for RFC in ESS_USERS_OF_ROLE_GET

**Title:** 2062186 - Switchable authorization checks for RFC in ESS_USERS_OF_ROLE_GET

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Recency:** Updated  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 01.12.2014  
**Component:** Basis Components > Business Management > Organizational Management (BC-BMT-OM)

### Description

**Symptom**  
This SAP note describes new switchable authorization checks for RFC function modules in the function `ESS_USERS_OF_ROLE_GET`.

**Other Terms**  
SACF, RFC, authorization.

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
Remote calls to RFC function modules are protected by checks on the authorization object `S_RFC`. Authorizations for `S_RFC` must be limited to the required minimum authorizations for all users to ensure system security. Many RFC function modules can be sufficiently protected using `S_RFC` authorization checks. These RFC function modules often do not perform additional functional authorization checks. Please see [SAP Note 2008727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2008727) for further information on RFC Security.

It was identified that `S_RFC` authorization checks might not be sufficient to ensure secure execution for RFC function modules covered by this note. Activate new switchable authorization checks and update corresponding roles if these RFC function modules are included in `S_RFC` authorizations in your system.

The note [2044543](https://me.sap.com/notes/2044543) should be implemented in your system.

### Solution

New switchable authorization checks have been implemented. The checks are delivered inactive to ensure compatibility with your running processes. The checks can be activated in transaction SACF as described in [SAP Note 2044543](https://me.sap.com/notes/2044543).

**New authorization scenario(s):**  
The following new authorization scenarios can be maintained in transaction SACF after implementation of this SAP note.

**Scenario 1**  
HRBAS_ESS: see [SAP Note 2044543](https://me.sap.com/notes/2044543).

**Affected RFC function modules:**  
`ESS_USERS_OF_ROLE_GET`

**Implementation of the switchable authorization check**  
The switchable authorization scenario and the switchable authorization checks are provided via support package. They can be technically pre-implemented via below correction instructions. After technical implementation via support package or correction instructions, the checks remain inactive until manual activation.

**Activation of the switchable authorization check**  
See [SAP Note 2044543](https://me.sap.com/notes/2044543).
