Switchable authorization checks for RFC in IS-M, part 2 (SAP Note 2061519)

---

**Overview**

SAP Note **2061519** introduces new **switchable authorization checks** for RFC function modules in **IS-Media (IS-M)**. This enhancement ensures more robust security by supplementing existing authorization objects.

**Symptom**

Remote Function Calls (RFC) to function modules in IS-Media were previously protected solely by the authorization object **S_RFC**. It was identified that these checks might not be sufficient for secure execution, necessitating additional authorization mechanisms.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

- **Issue Identified:** The existing **S_RFC** authorization checks do not provide adequate security for certain RFC function modules.
- **Prerequisite:** SAP Note **2022888** ("Switchable authorization checks for RFC in IS-M") must be applied prior to this note.

**Solution**

New **switchable authorization checks** have been implemented and delivered inactive to maintain compatibility with ongoing processes. These checks can be activated using transaction **SACF** as per the provided manual correction instructions.

**Affected Business Processes and Roles**

- **Business Processes:** Reading plan quantities from Quantity Planning for Contracts in IS-Media, such as when copying a Quantity Plan via `RJKSDSQPCOPYMASTERSLAVE`.
- **RFC Function Modules:** `BAPI_CONTRACTDEMAND_GET`

**Implementation of the Switchable Authorization Check**

1. **Technical Implementation:** Apply the support package or correction instructions provided with the note. The checks remain inactive until manually activated.
2. **Activation Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Verify the productive scenario from definition **ISM_MPS** as per SAP Note **2022888**.
   - **Step 2:** Ensure the scenario status is **Active** or **Logging**.
   - **Step 3:** Configure the Security Audit Log to capture relevant audit messages.
   - **Step 4:** Adjust user roles to include the necessary authorizations based on the new checks.
