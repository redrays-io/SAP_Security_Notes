2067259 - RSUSR003 Wrong Password Status

**Description**

You are using the report `RSUSR003` to check the system security regarding SAP standard users. However, the evaluation of the status of user passwords is incorrect. Specifically, the information "User ID is not a system user" is incorrectly displayed in the column "Reason for User Lock".

**Issue Details:**
- **Symptom:**
  - The status of user passwords evaluated by `RSUSR003` is inaccurate.
  - Incorrect display of "User ID is not a system user" in the "Reason for User Lock" column.
  
- **Reason:**
  - Program error affecting the evaluation process.

- **Solution:**
  - Implement the correction instructions provided in the SNOTE.

**Additional Changes:**

- The message indicating that a user is not a system user is now correctly displayed in the "Information" column.
