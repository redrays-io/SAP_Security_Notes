SAP Security Note 1661734 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in LOD-ESO-AS

---

### Symptom

LOD-ESO-AS can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), LOD-ESO-AS

### Reason and Prerequisites

Several pages in LOD-ESO-AS are vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This vulnerability can be exploited to:

- Permanently modify displayed content on a website, allowing the attacker to embed malicious content that is rendered automatically without targeting victims individually.
- Steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this information may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the entire application may be fully compromised.

### Solution

Fixes have been developed and released in the following versions:

- **Version 5.0 J**
- **Version 5.1 Patch 10**
- **All Version 7.0 SP and patch releases**

To mitigate this risk, update to the appropriate release or patch version. You can download the fix using the [SNOTE download link](https://notesdownloads.sap.com/note/0040000017354852017) or view the [PDF version of the note](https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/sfm/notes/print/0001661734?language=en-US&token=C31DD9F98C6FE520115A4CA9ABCECB36).
