1661742 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in LOD-ESO-AS

### Description

**Symptom**

LOD-ESO-AS can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), LOD-ESO-AS

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Fixes have been developed and released in:
- **Version 5.0 J**
- **Version 5.1 Patch 10**
- **All Version 7.0 SP and patch releases**

Update to the appropriate release or patch version to mitigate this risk.
