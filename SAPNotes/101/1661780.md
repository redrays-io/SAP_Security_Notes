SAP Security Note 1661780: Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in PLM-CFO

**Symptom**
The PLM-CFO can be exploited by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Affected Components**
- Product Lifecycle Management > Collaboration Folders (PLM-CFO)

**Issue Details**
Pages within the PLM-CFO do not sufficiently encode input and output parameters, resulting in a reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This can allow attackers to:
- Deface or modify displayed content non-permanently.
- Steal user authentication information, enabling impersonation.
- Potentially achieve full compromise of the application's security, especially if an administrator is targeted.

**Solution**
Implement the program corrections provided in the Correction Instructions tab of this note. Ensure that all corrections are properly applied to your system.

**Release Information**
- **Released On:** May 8, 2012
- **Priority:** Correction with high priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer
