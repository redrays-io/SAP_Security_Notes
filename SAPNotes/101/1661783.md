1661783 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CA-GTF-DOB

## Description

**SAP Security Note 1661783** addresses a security vulnerability in CA-GTF-DOB that allows unauthorized modification of displayed application content. This issue can potentially enable attackers to obtain authentication information from legitimate users.

### Symptom

CA-GTF-DOB can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms

Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), CA-GTF-DOB, Document Builder

### Reason and Prerequisites

The page within CA-GTF-DOB does not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. This can be exploited to deface or modify displayed content on a website temporarily. Additionally, XSS can be used to steal another user's authentication information, which may allow attackers to impersonate the user and access data with the same rights. If an administrator is impersonated, the application's security could be fully compromised.

### Solution

Apply SAP Note 1661783 or the corresponding support package to resolve this security issue. The note includes a XSS check for the necessary output parameters.
