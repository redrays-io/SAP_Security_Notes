1661747 - Potential denial of service in LOD-ESO-AS

---

**Symptom**

An attacker can remotely exploit LOD-ESO-AS, rendering it and the resources that are used to service LOD-ESO-AS unavailable.

**Other Terms**

DoS, denial of service, LOD-ESO-AS

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The problem is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can launch a specifically crafted request that causes the process to consume excessive resources. As a result, no other processes can allocate new resources, rendering the system unavailable. This condition can be intentionally provoked by an attacker to cause a denial of service.

**Solution**

Fixes have been developed and released in version 5.0 J, Version 5.1 Patch 10, and all Version 7.0 SP and patch releases. Update to the appropriate Release/Patch version to mitigate this risk.
