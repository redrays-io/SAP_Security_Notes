### Title
**1772370 - Untrusted XML input parsing possible in KM UI**

### Description
A malicious user can modify an XML-based request to include XML content that is then parsed locally. This could allow a malicious user to perform a denial of service (DoS) on the parsing system, or access further network-located resources that are accessible from the parsing system.

**CVSS Information**  
- **Base Score:** 6.8  
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

### Other Terms
- XXE
- XML eXternal Entity
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- KM UI

### Reason and Prerequisites
The problem is caused by a program error in KM UI due to the incorrect use of an XML parser. By default, the parser opens external entities referenced within an XML input, which can then lead to malicious content being parsed. This malicious content can reference internal or external resources, such as files.
