**Release Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.11.2013  
**Component:** [Basis Components > Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) > Legal Case Management for ILM](https://me.sap.com/mynotes?tab=Search&sortBy=Relevance&filters=themk%25253Aeq~'BC-ILM-LCM*'%25252BreleaseStatus%25253Aeq~'CustomerRelease'%25252BsecurityPatchDay%25253Aeq~'NotRestricted'%25252BfuzzyThreshold%25253Aeq~'0.9'&flag=mynotes)

### **Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functions of BC-ILM-LCM to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**  
- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.0  
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P  

*Note:* SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this SAP Note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
BC-ILM-LCM does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's permissions to access certain functions. This oversight may result in undesired system behavior.

### **Solution**
Implement the correction instructions or import the Support Package referenced in this SAP Note.

**Comment:** An updated SAP Note [1933591](https://me.sap.com/notes/1933591) is available for Basis Release 701. If the structure `SLCM_S_OBJECT_IDENTIFIER` for one of the earlier Support Package levels does not exist in the system, this SAP Note describes the procedure for creating it manually.

### **Correction Instructions**
The changes from this SAP Note ensure that e-discovery reports can only be executed if they are entered in the table `LHM_EDIS_REPORTS`. If this condition is not met, e-discovery will terminate, and the system will issue an error message.

**To register e-discovery reports:**
1. In the SAP NetWeaver Implementation Guide, navigate to:
   - **Application Server** → **Basis Services** → **Information Lifecycle Management** → **Retention Management** → **Register E-Discovery Selection Programs**.
2. Enter the selection programs developed for e-discovery in the list.

### **Validity**
This SAP Note is applicable to the following SAP_BASIS versions:
- 701 to 702
- 710 to 730
- 731
- 740

### **Support Package**
Refer to the relevant [Support Packages](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB1772529) for your SAP_BASIS version to apply the necessary corrections.

### **Manual Activities**
- Perform manual registration of e-discovery reports as outlined in the solution section.

### **Preconditions**
Ensure that your system meets the prerequisites listed in the SAP Note to avoid any conflicts or issues during implementation.
