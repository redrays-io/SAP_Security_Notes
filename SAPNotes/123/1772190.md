SAP Security Note 1772190 - Unauthorized use of application functions in WEBCUIF

**Symptom**
An attacker can execute functions in WEBCUIF without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
Cross-site request forgery, XSRF, WEBCUIF

**Reason and Prerequisites**
WEBCUIF executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The attacker may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

**Solution**
Please implement the attached correction instructions or install the corresponding support package.
