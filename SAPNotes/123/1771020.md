1771020 - Code injection issue in BC-CMM-PRN

**Description**

A spool administration program contains code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice. An attacker can therefore control the behavior of the system, or can potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code, without having their own legitimate credentials.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.1
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:C
