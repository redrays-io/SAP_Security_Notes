1773912 - Missing authorization check in message server

## Description

An unauthenticated user can use functions of the message server to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### CVSS Information

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.3
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:N/I:N/A:C

_SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment.

### Reason and Prerequisites

The message server does not contain authorization checks for verifying a user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior or even enable a denial-of-service attack.

### Solution

Please apply a kernel with the patch level mentioned in this note, or a higher patch level.
