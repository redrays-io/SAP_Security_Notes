1773758 - Code injection vulnerability in TH_ENQUEUE_PERF

# Description

## Symptom
The function module `TH_ENQUEUE_PERF` contains code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice. An attacker can therefore control the behavior of the system or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without having legitimate credentials.

### CVSS Information
- **CVSS Base Score:** 7.5
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:C

## Other Terms
- Injection
- Execute
- Credentials
- `TH_ENQUEUE_PERF`

## Reason and Prerequisites
