1771706 - Directory traversal in PY-FI

## Description

**SAP Note 1771706** addresses a **Directory Traversal vulnerability in the PY-FI component**. This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to the remote server, potentially leading to data corruption or altered system behavior.

## Impact

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could:

- Overwrite data within the remote system
- Corrupt sensitive data
- Alter system behavior unpredictably

## Solution

To mitigate this vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. **Implement SAP Note 1497003**: Ensure that corrections from [SAP Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) are applied as they are prerequisites for implementing this note.

2. **Apply Relevant Support Packages**: Install the appropriate support packages for your software components as listed below:

   - **SAP_HR 46C**: [SAPKE46CJ5](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKE46CJ5)
   - **SAP_HRCFI 470**: [SAPK-470E0INSAPHRCFI](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPK-470E0INSAPHRCFI)
   - **SAP_HRCFI 500**: [SAPK-500A6INSAPHRCFI](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPK-500A6INSAPHRCFI)
   - **SAP_HRCFI 600**: [SAPK-60089INSAPHRCFI](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPK-60089INSAPHRCFI)
   - **SAP_HRCFI 604**: [SAPK-60455INSAPHRCFI](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPK-60455INSAPHRCFI)

3. **Configure Logical File Paths and Names**: Create logical file paths and names as per the Correction Instructions provided in the note. This involves using IMG activities or transaction FILE. Specific instructions include:

   - Creating the logical file path `HR_FI_DIR_DOWNLOAD`.
   - Assigning physical paths to the logical path based on your operating system.
   - Defining logical file names with appropriate data formats and application areas.
