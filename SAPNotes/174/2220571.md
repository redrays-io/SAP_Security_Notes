SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes).

### Reason and Prerequisites
Proxy registering pages within Java Proxy Runtime do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected XSS can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution
This issue is fixed with the Support Packages and Patches of the Software Components referenced by this note in the section **'SP Patch Level'**. Ensure to apply the relevant patches to mitigate the vulnerability.
