2227169 - Potential remote code execution in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author, Generator and Viewer

**Symptom**

An attacker can potentially exploit SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author, Generator or Viewer that enables them to take control of the product, including viewing, changing, or deleting data.

**CVSS Information**

* CVSS Base Score: 6.8 / 10
* CVSS Base Vector:

| Metric                     | Value     |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| AV : Access Vector         | Network (N) |
| AC : Access Complexity     | Medium (M) |
| Au : Authentication        | None (N)   |

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

**Other Terms**

Buffer overflow, RCE, remote code execution, SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author, SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Generator, SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer

**Reason and Prerequisites**

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in shared components used by SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author, Generator, and Viewer. This enables an attacker to inject code into the working memory that is subsequently executed by the application. It can also be used to cause a general fault in the product, causing the product to terminate.

**Solution**

**Workaround:**

The injected code cannot be executed when Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is enabled. All SAP 3D Visual Enterprise products, including Author, Generator, and Viewer, are explicitly marked for DEP, the flag is permanently set, and the user does not have to perform any additional steps to enable it. Protection in all SAP 3D Visual Enterprise products also does not depend on system-wide settings. DEP is available on all modern supported CPUs.

More information about DEP on Windows platform is available at:
- [Microsoft TechNet](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738483(v=ws.10).aspx)
- [Microsoft KB 899298](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/899298)

Additionally, as a precaution, users should only load models and drawings received from trusted sources.

**Please install the required support package.**
