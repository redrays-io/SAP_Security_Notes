2226028 - Potential information disclosure relating to iOS mobile applications

**Symptom**

An attacker can potentially discover information relating to SMP SDK native and Kapsel iOS applications.

UIWebView and WKWebView synchronous XMLHTTPRequests with BASIC authentication credentials set may fail to validate the server certificate upon re-establishing HTTPS connections. This can lead to the possibility of a Man In the Middle (MITM) attack where an illicit server could masquerade as the intended SMP server or reverse proxy server, terminate the HTTPS/SSL/TLS connection, and extract HTTP requests and responses in clear-text.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3 / 10
- **Attack Vector:** Network (N)
- **Access Complexity:** Medium (M)
- **Authentication:** None (N)
- **Impact to Confidentiality:** Partial (P)
- **Impact to Integrity:** None (N)
- **Impact to Availability:** None (N)

**Other Terms**

Information disclosure, MITM, UIWebView, WKWebView, XMLHTTPRequests

**Reason and Prerequisites**

This flaw in the iOS operating system affects all applications using the above APIs to make HTTPS requests (not limited to SAP applications or the SMP subset built on our SDK).

**Solution**

- **For iOS Device Owners:** Upgrade to iOS 9.0.1.
- **For Application Developers:** Upgrade to SMP 3.0 SDK SP10 or later and rebuild/redeploy your applications to protect users who do not upgrade their iOS operating system.

**Software Components Affected**

- **SAP_MOBILE_SDK:** Version 3.0 to 3.0+
