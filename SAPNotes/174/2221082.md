2221082 - Unauthorized use of application functions in WEBCUIF and CRMUIF

## Symptom

An attacker can execute functions in WEBCUIF and CRMUIF without authentication and authorization.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score**: 6.8 / 10
- **Vector**: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

## Reason and Prerequisites

WEBCUIF and CRMUIF execute certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. This can be achieved through cross-site scripting attacks or by presenting a malicious link to the victim.
