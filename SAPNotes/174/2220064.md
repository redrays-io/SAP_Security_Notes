2220064 - Potential denial of service in saposcol

**SAP Security Note 2220064: Potential Denial of Service in saposcol**

**Description:**
An attacker can locally exploit the NT version of `saposcol`, potentially rendering it and the resources used to serve `saposcol` unavailable.

**Symptom:**
An attacker can trigger a condition where the process enters an endless loop, consuming all available processing time. This causes the entire machine to become unresponsive until the process is manually terminated. This vulnerability can be exploited to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

**CVSS Information:**
- **Base Score:** 3.8 / 10
- **Vector:**
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L)
  - **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H)
  - **Authentication (Au):** Single (S)
  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** None (N)
  - **Integrity Impact (I):** None (N)
  - **Availability Impact (A):** Complete (C)

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
The issue is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can send a specifically crafted request that causes the `saposcol` process to consume excessive resources. Consequently, other processes cannot allocate new resources, making the system unavailable.

**Solution:**
Update your SapHostAgent 7.21 to the respective patch level.

**Affected Component:**
- **Component:** Basis Components > Computer Center Management System (CCMS) > CCMS Monitoring & Alerting > Operating System Monitoring Tool (BC-CCM-MON-OS)
