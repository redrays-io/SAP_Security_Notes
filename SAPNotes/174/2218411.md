2218411 - Potential remote termination of running processes in Adobe Document Services

**Symptom**
An attacker can remotely exploit SAP functions of Adobe Document Services so that they can terminate it manually.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The issue is caused by a memory corruption that causes the process to terminate. An attacker can provoke a condition in which the process attempts to read outside its memory space, causing a memory protection fault. As a result, the system terminates the process, rendering the application unusable until it is restarted manually.

**Solution**
Please apply the ADS patches mentioned in this SAP Note.
