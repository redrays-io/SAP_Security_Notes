2222731 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in DesignStudio SFIN use case

**Description**

### Symptom

Unauthorized modification of functionality in embedded analytics when using Design Studio embedded functionality as utilized in Simple Finance based on Netweaver 7.40. This issue does not affect standard Design Studio deployments on Netweaver, BI Platform, or HANA.

An attacker can abuse the embedded analytics functionality in Design Studio within Simple Finance to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Score:** 8.8

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you should conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, visit the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://support.sap.com/securitynotes).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The functionality does not sufficiently encode certain application parameters, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when they are loaded. A stored XSS attack can be used to permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Stored XSS can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. An attacker with access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

This problem has been resolved, and the fix is available. To mitigate this security issue, please implement the attached correction instruction or [Import Support Package 14 for SAP BW 7.40 (SAPKW74014)](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0002222731/30) into your system. This fix is also included in [Note 2210606 (Patch 1 for SP13)](https://me.sap.com/notes/2210606).
