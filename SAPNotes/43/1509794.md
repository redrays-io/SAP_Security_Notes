1509794 - Directory Traversal in transactions CL6E and CL6F

**Description**

**Symptom**
Transactions CL6E and CL6F contain a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to potentially read arbitrary files on the remote server, potentially disclosing confidential information.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Transactions CL6E and CL6F fail to correctly validate the path used to reference a file read from the remote server. This vulnerability allows an attacker to point the program to an arbitrary file on the system, disclosing its contents.

**Solution**
1. Ensure that the corrections contained in [Note 1512352](https://me.sap.com/notes/1512352) are implemented in your system.
2. Follow the correction instructions provided in this note as per the advance correction guidelines.
3. Refer to [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) for additional information. Program changes from this note are also required as a prerequisite.
4. Logical file names have been created to validate physical file names:
   - `DIN_CLASS` for transaction CL6E
     - Logical path name: `DIN_CLASS_PATH`
   - `DIN_CHARACTERISTIC` for transaction CL6F
     - Logical path name: `DIN_CHARACTERISTIC_PATH`
