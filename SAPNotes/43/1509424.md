1509424 - RE-Classic Potential Directory Traversal

**Description**

Potential Directory Traversal in the following components:

- RE-BD
- RE-RT

**Other Terms**

RFVIGESH; RFVIGRSH; RFVIMESH; RFVIMESH_OLD; RFVIMVSH; RFVIWESH; Path traversal

**Reason and Prerequisites**

1. The programs contained in the correction instructions contain vulnerabilities through which a malicious user can potentially read arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly disclosing confidential information.
2. The programs contained in the correction instructions contain a vulnerability through which a malicious user can potentially write arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

**Solution**

The mentioned programs are used in RE-Classic for legacy data transfer. As RE-Classic is an old product (see also [note 443311](https://me.sap.com/notes/443311)) for which the successor product RE-FX exists, we decided to remove the critical coding inside the programs contained in the correction instructions. After implementing the correction, the programs do not work anymore. If you use these programs nevertheless, please submit a customer message under subject area RE-BD or RE-RT with reference to this note.
