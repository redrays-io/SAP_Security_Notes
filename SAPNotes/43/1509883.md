1509883 - FI-CA Data Transfer - Directory Traversal

**SAP Security Note 1509883: FI-CA Data Transfer - Directory Traversal**

**Symptom**
An FI-CA program for data transfer contains a vulnerability through which a malicious user can potentially read or change arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

**Other Terms**
FP-DTRANS, directory, traversal, data transfer

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The programs contained in the correction instructions fail to correctly validate the path which a file that is read or changed from the remote server is referenced. This means that an attacker can potentially read or change data on the remote system.

**Solution**
Please implement the attached correction instruction.  
Refer to [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from Note 1497003 are a prerequisite for the implementation of this note.
