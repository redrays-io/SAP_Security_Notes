SAP Security Note 1509807 - Code Injection Vulnerability in IS-PRA

**Overview**
SAP has released Security Note **1509807**, addressing a critical code injection vulnerability identified in the **IS-PRA** component (Industry-Specific Components > Oil > Production and Revenue Accounting). This vulnerability allows malicious users to execute arbitrary program code, potentially leading to unauthorized system behavior or privilege escalation.

**Details**

- **SAP Note Number:** 1509807
- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Category:** Program Error
- **Priority:** Correction with High Priority
- **Released On:** March 8, 2011
- **Component:** IS-OIL-PRA

**Symptom**
The PRA application contains code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code chosen by the user. A malicious user can manipulate the system's behavior or escalate privileges by executing malicious code without legitimate credentials.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The vulnerability exists because the program code allows defining and executing user-supplied code, altering the system's behavior. To exploit this, an authenticated user is required. Depending on the injected code, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, modify or delete data, alter system outputs, create users with higher privileges, or perform denial of service attacks.

**Solution**
Apply SAP Note **1509344**, which contains the necessary corrections to address the vulnerability described in Note **1509807**. Implementing this note will safeguard the PRA application against code injection attacks.
