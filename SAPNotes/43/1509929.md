### Description

#### Symptom
A malicious user can trigger functionality in FIN-SEM-CPM without authentication and authorization.

#### Other Terms
Cross-Site Request Forgery, XSRF, FIN-SEM-CPM

#### Reason and Prerequisites
FIN-SEM-CPM executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the user.

The malicious user may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

#### Solution
1. Apply correction instructions using transaction SNOTE.
2. For additional information and instructions, see [Note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324). The corrections from Note 1520324 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.
3. Implement the correction instructions provided in this note. Create the report `ZBSP_XSRF_PARAM_FIN_SEM_CPM` as a local object in your system.
4. Execute the report `ZBSP_XSRF_PARAM_FIN_SEM_CPM` and when requested, specify a relevant transport request number. The report will fill the database table `BSPTEMPXSRFSTORE`.
5. Update also Java applets - the applets and the how-tos are stored in corresponding notes [650274](https://me.sap.com/notes/650274), [650264](https://me.sap.com/notes/650264), [650252](https://me.sap.com/notes/650252), [650241](https://me.sap.com/notes/650241).
