### Description
A malicious user can trigger functionality in the IS-Oil and Gas Service Station Workbench without proper authentication and authorization.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The SAP IS-Oil Store Workbench executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. An attacker can trick an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a particular URL and specific parameters, causing the function to execute with the user's permissions. Potential attack vectors include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or presenting a deceptive link for the victim to click.

### Impact
Exploiting this vulnerability allows unauthorized users to perform actions within the IS-Oil and Gas Service Station Workbench, potentially leading to data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information, or disruption of services.
