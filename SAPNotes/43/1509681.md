1509681 - Inserting ABAP code in SAP Payment Engine

### Description

**Symptom**

The SAP Payment Engine contains ABAP code that may enable an attacker to introduce their own code and execute it.

**Other Terms**

Code injection

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The program contains statements that enable a user to execute their own code, resulting in a changed system response. The user must be logged on with valid system access and have authorization to execute reports. Depending on the code inserted, additional information access may be required, which is not guaranteed. Furthermore, the user may change or delete data, manipulate system output, or create new users with increased privileges. Additionally, the availability of the system is endangered.

### Solution

Implement the source code corrections manually.

Use transaction SE38 to delete the report `/PE4/PE_PP_IF_SHOW_REP_PARAMS`.
