SAP Security Note 2035923: Missing authorization check in SD Credit cards

**Description**

An authenticated user can utilize functions of credit cards in Sales and Distribution (SD) to which access should be restricted. This vulnerability may lead to an escalation of privileges, potentially resulting in unauthorized actions within the system.

**Symptom**

- Unauthorized access to credit card functions in SD.
- Potential escalation of user privileges without proper authorization checks.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

**Solution**

Apply the provided correction to enforce proper authorization checks within the SD credit card functions.
