Information such as the release and patch level of the system can be obtained via a function module. This information may be used by an attacker to further target the ABAP Application Server.

### Solution

Please install the Support Package (SP) mentioned. An implementation via automatic correction instructions is not possible due to SNOTE restrictions.
