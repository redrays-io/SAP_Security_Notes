### **Symptom**
An attacker can exploit Afaria and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands. This results in either the retrieval of additional information or the modification of data persisted by the system.

### **CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 8.7
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:S/C:P/I:C/A:C

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by an attacker. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to retrieve additional data from the database or to modify the data.

### **Solution**
Customers should roll out **Afaria 7 SP4 HF7**.
