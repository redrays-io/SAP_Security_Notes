**Other Terms**

Agentry

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The Agentry 6.1.3 iOS and Android Clients are vulnerable to spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks and are vulnerable to manipulation of user data.

**Solution**

Both the Agentry Client and the Agentry Server must be upgraded to SMP 2.3 SP04 PL01 (or greater). This corresponds to Agentry versions 6.1.4.304 (or greater). After performing the upgrade, certificate validation and client database encryption must be enabled via the instructions below.

The latest Agentry components from SMP 2.3 can be downloaded from Service Marketplace:

1. The instructions for enabling certificate validation can be found in the related SAP Note [2019982](https://me.sap.com/notes/0002036547/D) "Instructions for configuring certificates in Agentry clients and server".
2. The instructions for enabling encryption for client local storage are the following:
   - Upgrade the Agentry Server, Agentry Editor, and Agentry Clients to SMP 2.3 SP04 PL01 (or greater)
   - Open the Agentry application definitions in the Agentry Editor and enable "Database encryption" on the "Application Security" tab
   - Publish the updated application definitions to the Agentry Server
   - Transmit from each Agentry Client to encrypt each client's local database

Enabling the Agentry Client's local database encryption addresses "Run time manipulation attacks on mobile application" by ensuring that all user-specific data, including the username, is safely stored in the encrypted client database.
