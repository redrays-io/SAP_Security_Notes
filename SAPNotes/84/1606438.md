1606438 - Unauthorized change of delivered content in BW

**Symptom**

An attacker with special authorizations can manipulate objects in the area of the application component BW-BCT-TCT-IQM to change the displayed application content of another user without authorization, and possibly access authentication information of other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

- Stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
- BW-BCT-TCT-IQM

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The manipulation of an error message leads to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. To execute the manipulation, the attacker must have special authorizations to change configurations and insert malicious code. This type of XSS can be used to permanently modify website content, embed automatically generated malicious content, and steal users' authentication information. If an administrator's credentials are compromised, the application's security may be fully breached.
