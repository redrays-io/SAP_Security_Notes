SAP Security Note 1605054: Restriction in access to FTP Servers & usage of test reports

**SAP Security Note 1605054** was released on August 29, 2012, addressing a critical security issue in the `BC-SRV-COM-FTP` component. This note restricts access to FTP servers and enhances the security around the usage of test reports to prevent unauthorized file operations.

### Symptom
FTP function modules previously allowed users to connect to any FTP Server without restrictions, posing a risk where malicious users could write arbitrary files, leading to data corruption or altered system behavior.

### CVSS Information
- **CVSS Base Score:** 5.5
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:N

**Note:** The CVSS score provided is an estimate of the risk and does not replace a comprehensive risk assessment tailored to your specific environment. For more details, visit [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Solution
Implement the correction instructions provided in the note, followed by manual configuration to enforce FTP server restrictions and control access to FTP test reports.

#### Required Manual Configuration
1. **Restrict FTP Test Reports Usage:**
   - Assign the authority object `S_ADMI_FCD` with the field `SFTP` to users responsible for administrative or testing tasks.
   - Refer to [Note 1659034](https://me.sap.com/notes/1659034) if the `SFTP` field is unavailable during assignment.

2. **Maintain FTP Server Whitelist:**
   - Navigate to transaction `SE16`.
   - Access the table `SAPFTP_SERVERS`.
   - Create entries specifying the client, server name, and port to allow access.
   - Alternatively, allow access to any FTP server by setting the server name to `*`.
