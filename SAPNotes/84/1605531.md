1605531 - Credentials are stored in memory by SAP MDM GDS 2.1

**SAP Security Note 1605531 - Credentials are stored in memory by SAP MDM GDS 2.1**

### Symptom
- Credentials of logged-in users are kept in memory for the duration of their session.
- When user properties are read from MDM, passwords are kept in memory until the application is stopped.
- A malicious user with an operating system account on the GDS server and appropriate rights may steal credentials from the memory.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The GDS application unnecessarily retains user credentials in plain text in memory for an extended period, increasing the risk of credential theft by malicious users with access to the server's operating system.

### Solution
Implement the relevant patch for SAP MDM GDS 2.1 to address this vulnerability.
