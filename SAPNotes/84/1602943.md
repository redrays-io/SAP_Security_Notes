1602943 - FI-CA Potential directory traversal

**SAP Security Note 1602943 - FI-CA Potential Directory Traversal**

**Symptom**
Potential directory traversal in the following components: FI-CA

**Other Terms**
- Directory traversal
- FI-CA

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The programs contained in the correction instructions have vulnerabilities that allow a malicious user to potentially:
- Read arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly disclosing confidential information.
- Write arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

**Solution**
1. **Implement the Correction Instruction**
   - Download and apply the correction instruction from the [Download for SNOTE](https://notesdownloads.sap.com/note/0040000009518942017).

2. **Refer to Prerequisite Notes**
   - Ensure that you have implemented the corrections from [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) as they are prerequisites for this note.

**Logical File Names Used in this Solution**
- FI-CA-CVS

**Recommendations for Setting Up Logical File Names**
- To avoid maintaining a high number of logical file names, some programs share the same logical file name. This creates dependencies among these programs.
- Securely separate data created by different users and programs by creating a directory structure that reflects the user name and/or program name.
- Use this structured information when setting up the physical path and file names for the logical file paths and file names.
