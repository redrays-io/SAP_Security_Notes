2026763 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in webcuif

**Description**

Webcuif can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 3.5
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:N/I:P/A:N

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).*

**Other Terms**

- Stored cross-site scripting, XSS, webcuif

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The Webcuif business text framework `<thtmlb:btf>` can result in a stored cross-site scripting issue. This vulnerability allows attackers to permanently modify displayed content on a website, embedding content that is rendered automatically without targeting victims individually. Additionally, stored cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as session data. An attacker who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

To resolve the cross-site scripting issue in SAP applications that display and process HTML documents, you need to install the relevant support package or implement the correction instructions listed in this note.
