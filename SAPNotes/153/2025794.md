SAP Security Note 2025794 - Missing authority check in CA-MDG-APP-ISS

### **Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functions of CA-MDG-APP-ISS (Integrated Self Service) to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### **Other Terms**
ISS FSSC Authorization authorization check

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
CA-MDG-APP-ISS does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its remotely called functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

### **Solution**
Implement the attached code correction or the relevant [support package](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKH60513).
