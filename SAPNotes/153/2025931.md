**SAP Security Note 2025931 - Potential Remote Code Execution in BC-SEC**

**Symptom**

An attacker can exploit BC-SEC to gain complete control of the product, including viewing, changing, or deleting data.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 7.1
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/AU:S/C:C/I:C/A:C

**Reason and Prerequisites**

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in BC-SEC. This allows an attacker to inject code into the working memory, which is executed by the application, or cause the application to terminate. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to create and run or modify ABAP source code. No known existing interfaces directly expose the vulnerability.
