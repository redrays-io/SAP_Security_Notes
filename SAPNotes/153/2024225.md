2024225 - Switchable authorization checks for RFC in CO-OM and CO-PA

**SAP Note 2024225** addresses a critical security enhancement by introducing switchable authorization checks for RFC (Remote Function Call) function modules in the Controlling Overhead Costing (CO-OM) and Profitability Analysis (CO-PA) applications. This update is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential privilege escalation within these modules.

### **Description**
Authenticated users may exploit certain functions in CO-PA that lack sufficient authorization checks, potentially leading to unauthorized access and escalation of privileges. This SAP note provides a solution by implementing additional authorization controls to ensure secure execution of RFC function modules.

### **Issue**
- **CO-PA Vulnerability:** Users can access restricted functions in CO-PA without proper authorization, leading to potential privilege escalation.
- **Insufficient RFC Checks:** Existing S_RFC authorization checks may not be adequate for all RFC function modules, necessitating enhanced security measures.

### **Solution**
Implement the support package or correction instructions provided in this SAP note to activate new switchable authorization checks. These checks are initially inactive to maintain compatibility with existing processes and require manual activation via transaction SACF.

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Download and Apply Support Package:**
   - [Download for SNOTE](https://notesdownloads.sap.com/note/0040000012035882017)
   - [PDF Version](https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/sfm/notes/print/0002024225?language=en-US&token=DCB36B5549C9B42A4306D4E9DE0D7082)

2. **Activate Authorization Checks:**
   - **Create Authorization Scenario Definition:**
     - Go to transaction `SACF` and verify if `COOM_MASTERDATA` and `COOM_PLANNING` scenarios exist.
     - If not, download the [CO_OM_SACF_SCENARIO_DATA.TXT](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKH506325) file and upload it using `SACF_TRANSFER`.
   - **Create Productive Authorization Scenario:**
     - In `SACF`, transfer the scenario definitions to productive scenarios and set the status to "Active" or "Logging".
   
3. **Configure Security Audit Log:**
   - Ensure the Security Audit Log is active via transaction `SM19`.
   - Create and activate relevant audit filters to monitor authorization events.
   
4. **Update User Roles:**
   - Use report `RSAU_SELECT_EVENTS` to identify users needing additional authorizations.
   - Adjust roles to include necessary authorizations based on the new scenarios.
