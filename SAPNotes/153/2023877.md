SAP Security Note 2023877 - Code injection vulnerability in Bulgarian Cash Flow and Equity Reports

## Description

### Symptom
Bulgarian Cash and Equity Reports contain code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice.  
An attacker can therefore control the behavior of the system, or can potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code, without having their own legitimate credentials.

### Other Terms
Injection, run, credentials, Bulgaria, Cash Flow Report, Equity Report, `/BGLOCS/FI_CFSREP_TOP`, `/BGLOCS/FI_EQREP_TOP`, `/BGLOCS/FI_EQREP01_TOP`, `/BGLOCS/FI_EQREP02_TOP`

### Reason and Prerequisites
The program code contains a possibility to define and execute user-defined code that changes the behavior of the system. A valid and authenticated user is [required / not required].  
Depending on the code, the user can:

- Inject and run their own code
- Obtain additional information that should not be displayed
- Modify data, delete data
- Modify the output of the system
- Create new users with higher privileges
- Perform a denial of service attack
