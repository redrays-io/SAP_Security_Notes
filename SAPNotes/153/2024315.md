### Title
**User-driven dynamic procedure calls vulnerability in C-CEE add-on**

### Symptom
C-CEE add-on contains user-driven dynamic procedure calls that permit the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice. An attacker can therefore control the behavior of the system or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without having their own legitimate credentials.

An attacker can be authenticated to affected reports without having their own legitimate credentials or may escalate privileges.

### Other Terms
C-CEE, user-driven dynamic procedure call, /BGLOCS/VATREPORT07_MENU, MJ1GFBWEF15

### Reason and Prerequisites
The program code contains a possibility to define and execute user-defined code that changes the behavior of the system. A valid and authenticated user is [required / not required]. Depending on the code, the user can:
- Inject and run their own code
- Obtain additional information that should not be displayed
- Modify data, delete data
- Modify the output of the system
- Create new users with higher privileges
- Perform a denial of service attack
