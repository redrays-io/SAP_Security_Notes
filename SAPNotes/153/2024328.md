#### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functions of AS Java to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

#### CVSS Information
**CVSS Base Score**: 3.6 / 10  
**CVSS Base Vector**:

| Metric                                         | Value     |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| AV : Access Vector (Related exploit range)     | Local (L) |
| AC : Access Complexity (Required attack complexity) | Low (L)   |
| Au : Authentication (Level of authentication needed to exploit) | None (N) |
| C : Impact to Confidentiality                 | None (N)  |
| I : Impact to Integrity                        | Partial (P) |

#### Other Terms
Authorization, SAP NetWeaver

#### Reason and Prerequisites
AS Java does not define authorization checks for an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in an undesired system behavior.

#### Solution
Update your AS Java to a Support Package (SP) or release where the issue is fixed. See the [SP Patch Level section](https://me.sap.com/) for details and available patches.
