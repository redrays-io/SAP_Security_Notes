2252568 - Switchable authorization checks for RFC in Internet Service

**SAP Note Number:** 2252568  
**Title:** Switchable authorization checks for RFC in Internet Service  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Component:** CRM-ISE (Internet Service)  
**Release Date:** October 11, 2016  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  

### Description
This SAP Security Note introduces new switchable authorization checks for RFC (Remote Function Call) function modules in Internet Service and Complaints and Returns. The enhancement aims to strengthen system security by ensuring that authorizations are restricted to the minimum necessary for all users.

### Symptom
S_RFC authorization checks may not sufficiently secure RFC function modules, potentially allowing unauthorized access and insecure executions of these modules.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Remote calls to RFC function modules are governed by the authorization object **S_RFC**. To maintain system security, authorizations for **S_RFC** should be limited to the essential minimum. While many RFC function modules are adequately protected using **S_RFC** checks, they often lack additional functional authorization checks. This note addresses the identified insufficiency by introducing switchable authorization checks that enhance security.

**Prerequisites:**
- Ensure that SAP Note [2236076](https://me.sap.com/notes/2236076) is applied.
- Verify system compatibility with the supported software components.

### Solution
The solution involves activating the new switchable authorization checks through transaction **SACF**. The checks are initially inactive to maintain compatibility with existing processes and can be activated manually as needed. Detailed manual correction instructions are provided within the note to guide the activation process.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Authorization Scenario Definitions:**
   - **Scenario 1:** `CRM_ICSS_1`
   - **Scenario 2:** `CRM_ICSS_CR_1`
   - Use transaction **SACF_TRANSFER** to upload the scenario definition files (`CRM_ICSS_1.TXT` and `CRM_ICSS_CR_1.TXT`) attached to this note.

2. **Activate Productive Authorization Scenarios:**
   - In transaction **SACF**, transfer the scenario definitions to productive scenarios.
   - Set the status to **Active** or **Logging** to enable authorization checks and logging.

3. **Enable Security Audit Logging:**
   - Ensure Security Audit Log is activated in transaction **SM19**.
   - Activate relevant message IDs (e.g., DUO, DUP, DUQ) for comprehensive auditing.

4. **Adjust User Roles:**
   - Update user roles to include the necessary authorizations based on the new scenarios.
   - Use report **RSAU_SELECT_EVENTS** to identify and assign required authorizations.

**Detailed manual activities are outlined in the note to ensure proper implementation.**
