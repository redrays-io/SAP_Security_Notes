2248790 - Switchable authorization checks for RFC in Intellectual Property Management

**SAP Note 2248790** introduces new switchable authorization checks for RFC function modules in Intellectual Property Management (IPM). This enhancement ensures that remote calls to RFC function modules are secured by stringent authorization object checks, thereby strengthening system security.

### **Description**
Remote Function Call (RFC) function modules in IPM are now protected with additional authorization checks using the `S_RFC` authorization object. This update addresses potential security gaps by limiting access to the necessary minimum authorizations required for users, ensuring that only authorized personnel can execute specific RFC functions.

### **Solution**
The implementation involves activating new switchable authorization checks via transaction SACF. These checks are initially inactive to maintain compatibility with existing processes and can be enabled manually as needed. The solution includes:

1. **Creating the Authorization Scenario:**
   - Use transaction `SACF` to verify if the scenario `CRM_IPM_1` exists.
   - If absent, download the `CRM_IPM_1.txt` file from the [Attachments](https://me.sap.com/notes/0002248790/D) section and upload it using transaction `SACF_TRANSFER`.
   - Assign the scenario to the development package `CRM_IPM_GENERAL`.

2. **Activating the Scenario:**
   - In transaction `SACF`, convert the scenario definition to a productive scenario.
   - Choose between `Active` or `Logging` status to activate authorization checks and enable logging to the Security Audit Log.

3. **Adjusting Roles:**
   - Identify and grant necessary authorizations to users based on audit messages using report `RSAU_SELECT_EVENTS`.
   - Utilize system traces (`STAUTHTRACE` or `ST01`) for detailed analysis.

4. **Maintaining RFC Function Modules:**
   - Update default authorization values for relevant RFC function modules in transaction `SU22`.

### **Prerequisites**
- Compatible with Software Components BBPCRM releases 700, 701, 702, 712, 713, and 714.
- Ensure that Security Audit Log is activated in transaction `SM19`.
