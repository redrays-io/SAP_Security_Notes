1608934 - Potential loss of integrity in web app Terminology Tools

**Description**

**Symptom**
Terminology tools can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users. Additionally, a malicious user can execute functions in terminology tools without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, cross-site request forgery, XSRF, Terminology/Glossary

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Pages within terminology tools do not sufficiently encode INPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a web site. This type of attack can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

Additionally, terminology tools execute certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. This can be achieved through a cross-site scripting attack or by presenting a deceptive link to the victim.
