Security Vulnerability: Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in BC-MOB-MI (SAP Note 1609289)

**Symptom**

BC-MOB-MI-SER can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

- XSS
- Reflected Cross Site Scripting
- BC-MOB-MI-SER

**Reason and Prerequisites**

BSP Pages within the component BC-MOB-MI-SER do not sufficiently encode input and output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected XSS can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
