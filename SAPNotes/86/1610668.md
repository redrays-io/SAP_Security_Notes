### Description

#### Symptom

BC-SRV-GBT-ALM can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.  
This security note has been updated.  
For more detailed information, see [Security Note 1885280](https://me.sap.com/notes/1885280).

#### Other Terms

Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, BC-SRV-GBT-ALM

#### Reason and Prerequisites

The BSP pages in BC-SRV-GBT-ALM do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.  
Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
