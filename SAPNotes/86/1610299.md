1610299 - Unauthorized change to contents in PI message monitoring

**Description**

A PI message can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
- Cross-site-scripting (XSS)
- PI message monitoring

**Reason and Prerequisites**

A PI message results in a stored cross-site scripting issue. It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the malicious user to embed content that is rendered automatically without having to target victims individually. Stored cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
