1609433 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in WEBCUIF

**Description**

### Symptom
WEBCUIF can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, WEBCUIF

### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within WEBCUIF do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Additionally, such attacks can steal another user's authentication information, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate the user and access information with the same privileges. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
