### Reason and Prerequisites

To support landscape monitoring in trusted networks, some functions are exposed in the SDEFAULT configuration without further authentication to allow access to monitoring information.

See note [1439348 - Extended security settings for sapstartsrv](https://me.sap.com/notes/1439348) to read further details and the recommended settings.

### Solution

If you have concerns about this disclosure, we recommend reviewing your network security settings within the communication channels which are using sapstartsrv.

- **Limit network access** to your SAP HANA server and sapstartsrv to only those clients needed for your administration/monitoring scenario.
- Refer to note [2559588](https://me.sap.com/notes/2559588) for consequences when a higher security setting of sapstartsrv is used.
