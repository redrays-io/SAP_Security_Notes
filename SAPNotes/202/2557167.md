2557167 - Potential code injection vulnerability in Crystal Reports Java components

### Symptom
Crystal Reports Java components could allow an attacker to inject code that can be executed by the application. An attacker could thereby control the behavior of the application.

### Other Terms
Crystal Reports for Enterprise, CR4E, CRE, BusinessObjects

### Reason and Prerequisites
The potential vulnerability would require an attacker to gain access to the file system that hosts an SAP BusinessObjects deployment.  From there, the attacker would need to modify Java files and perform actions that cause the modified code to get executed.  Doing so effectively requires the attacker to have access to the Java source code.
