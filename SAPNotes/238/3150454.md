### Description

**Symptom**

**UPDATE 4th October 2022:**

**UPDATE 27th September 2022:**  
As the correction instructions may give an implementation error, the correction instructions have been adjusted.

**UPDATE 13th September 2022:**  
As the correction instructions lead to syntax errors, the correction instructions have been adjusted.

**UPDATE 23rd August 2022:**  
This note has been re-released with updated 'Correction instruction' information. We have updated the Correction instruction to support the later implementation of the lower SP levels in the customer systems.

A high privileged user who has access to transaction SM59 can read connection details stored with the destination for RFC calls in SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP and ABAP Platform.

**Other Terms**

Information Exposure, Information Leak, Type 3

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The authorization check for RFC destinations fails to validate authorization in some cases of change. RFC destination parameters that are critical for security are not initialized if the parameter values of the authorization check for destination maintenance or the data of the target system change.

**Solution**

The correction introduces authorization re-validation in case an administrator changes parameters of an RFC destination, whose values are subject to the underlying authorization check.

Please update your ABAP System at least to the Support Package mentioned in this SAP Note, or implement the correction instruction.
