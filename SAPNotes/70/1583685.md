**Other Terms:**  
SQL injection, database, CRM-PCF, CA-GTF-PCF

**Reason and Prerequisites:**  
The issue arises from an SQL injection vulnerability. The vulnerable code constructs an SQL statement that includes strings manipulable by an attacker. This manipulated statement can then be used to extract data from the database.
