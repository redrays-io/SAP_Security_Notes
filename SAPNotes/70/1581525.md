SAP Security Note 1581525 - Update #1 to Security Note 1503856

**Description:**
SAP Security Note 1581525 addresses an update to the previously released Security Note 1503856. The update was necessary due to missing Support Package patch level entries in the initial release. This update includes the following newly-added Support Package patch levels for the MESSAGING SYSTEM SERVICE 7.20:

- SP01 Patch Level 3
- SP02 Patch Level 3
- SP03 Patch Level 3
- SP04 Patch Level 2
- SP05 Patch Level 1
- SP06 Patch Level 0

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
The update was required because the original Security Note 1503856 lacked the necessary Support Package patch level entries, which are crucial for ensuring the security and stability of the affected components.

**Solution:**
To resolve the issue, apply the provided patches to the MESSAGING SYSTEM SERVICE 7.20 component. For older Support Packages, the correction is available as a patch. Ensure that software components of the Adapter Engine are updated to the specified patch levels detailed in the "SP Patch Level" section of the note or consider upgrading to newer versions.
