1581644 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CRM-BPS

## Symptom
The CRM sales planning in BW-BPS can be exploited by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability may allow the attacker to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

## Other Terms
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Sales Planning UI

## Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within the sales planning component of BW-BPS do not sufficiently encode parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this to:
- Non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on the website.
- Steal another user's authentication information, such as session data.
- Impersonate the targeted user and gain access to information with the same permissions.
- Fully compromise the application's security if an administrator is impersonated.
