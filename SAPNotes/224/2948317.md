**Symptom**

1. **CKEditor Vulnerability (CVE-2020-9281):**  
   SAP Commerce uses a vulnerable version of the CKEditor library that does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs. This results in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts through crafted "protected" comments.

2. **jQuery Vulnerability (CVE-2019-11358):**  
   The jQuery library in use mishandles the `extend` method due to prototype pollution. This vulnerability affects SAP Commerce installations that utilize the smartedit module.
