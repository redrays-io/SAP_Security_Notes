2948239 - [CVE-2020-6324] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP (BSP Test Application)

**Symptom**
BSP Test Application `sbspext_table` allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a polluted URL to the victim, enabling Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Information available in the victim's web browser can be read, modified, and sent to the attacker. No sensitive data is disclosed, and service disruption is not possible as the attack is limited to the test application.

**Other Terms**

- **Categories:** CSS, Reflected XSS, XSS

**Reason and Prerequisites**
For a successful attack, the SICF service node of the relevant BSP test application must be enabled within the Application Server ABAP.

**Solution**
The URL parameters are now properly encoded to prevent a successful XSS attack. This issue was never exploitable within productive Cloud products hosted by SAP, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud Edition.
