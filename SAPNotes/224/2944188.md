2944188 - [CVE-2020-6316] Missing Authorization Check in SAP ERP and SAP S/4 HANA

**Symptom**
  
*Update 9th March 2021*: This note has been re-released with updated 'Correction instruction' information.

SAP ERP and SAP S/4 HANA allow an authenticated user to view cost records for objects to which they do not have authorization in PS reporting.

**Impact**

An authenticated user with limited permissions can access sensitive cost records, potentially leading to unauthorized disclosure of financial information.

**Solution**

Implement the code changes via transaction `SNOTE`. After applying the note, users will only see objects within a project that they are authorized to access.
