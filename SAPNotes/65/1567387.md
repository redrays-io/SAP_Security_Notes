1567387 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in DTN

### Description
The portal's Detail Navigation can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Symptom
A malicious user can exploit the Detail Navigation to modify and persist application content without authorization. This can lead to unauthorized access to authentication information of other users.

### CVSS Information
- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

*Note:* SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. It does not account for your system configuration or operational environment. Conduct your own risk assessments to determine the applicability and priority of this security note. More information is available in the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Reason and Prerequisites
DTN within Navigation does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to deface or modify displayed content and steal authentication information, potentially impersonating users, including administrators, thereby compromising the application's security.
