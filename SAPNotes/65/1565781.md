1565781 - Buyer: Sec. note for cross-site scripting & BSP applications

# SAP Security Note 1565781: Buyer - Cross-Site Scripting & BSP Applications

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.05.2012  
**Component:** Enterprise Portal > SAP Enterprise Portal Content > Purchasing Packages > BP for Buyer

## Symptom

The BSP applications of the buyer portal role can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users. This affects the "Document Tracing" and "Edit Deviating Vendor Confirmations" BSP applications.

## Other Terms

Reflected cross-site scripting, cross-site scripting, buyer, Business Server Page (BSP), security

## Reason and Prerequisites

"Document Tracing" and "Edit Deviating Vendor Confirmations" within the buyer portal role do not sufficiently encode input/output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
