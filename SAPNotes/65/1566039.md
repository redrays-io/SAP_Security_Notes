**SAP Note 1566039 - Unauthorized changes and execution for RSBCT_RFASH_ALI**

**Description**

This security note addresses issues in the Business Server Page (BSP) of the article list retraction application:

1. **Unauthorized Use of Application Functions**: A malicious user can execute functions of the article list BSP without proper authentication and authorization.
2. **Unauthorized Modification of Stored Content**: The article list BSP can be exploited to modify displayed application content without authorization, potentially stealing authentication information from legitimate users.

**Symptoms**
- Malicious execution of BSP functions via unauthorized access.
- Modification of BSP content leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
- **Symptom 1**: Unauthorized execution occurs when a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making specific requests, possibly using cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Symptom 2**: Manipulation of BSP components allows permanent modification of web content and theft of user authentication data.
- **Prerequisite**: Implementation of [Note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324) is required before applying this security note.

**Solution**
1. **Implement Correction Instructions**: Follow the correction instructions provided in this note to address the vulnerabilities.
2. **Execute the Report BSP_XSRF_PARAM_RSBCT_RFASH_ALI**: Specify a relevant transport request number when prompted. This will populate the database table BSPTEMPXSRFSTORE with necessary entries for the adapted BSP applications.
