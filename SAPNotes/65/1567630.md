1567630 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BC-DOC-TTL

**Description**
This SAP Security Note addresses a reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the translation tools of BC-DOC-TTL. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to modify displayed application content without authorization or steal authentication information from other users.

**Details**

- **Symptom:**  
  The translation tools can be abused by a malicious user, allowing unauthorized modification of displayed content and potential theft of authentication information from legitimate users.

- **Reason and Prerequisites:**  
  Pages within the translation tools do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected XSS issue. This can be exploited to deface or modify web content temporarily and steal user session data, potentially leading to full security compromises if an administrator's credentials are obtained.

- **Solution:**  
  Implement the changes outlined in the attached correction instructions for your system. This note disables obsolete code, and no additional testing is required post-implementation.
