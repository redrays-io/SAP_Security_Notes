**SAP Security Note 1567389: Missing authorization checks in Runtime Workbench**

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functionality of some Runtime Workbench applications to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**
- **Base Score:** 6.4
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:N

*Note:* The CVSS score is an estimate of the risk posed by this issue and does not account for specific system configurations or environments. It's recommended to conduct your own risk assessments when determining the applicability or priority of this security note. More information is available in the [FAQ section](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Some JSP pages lack permission checks for an authenticated user's authorization to access certain functionalities. This omission may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**
The following Support Packages include fixes with additional authentication checks for the described security issue:

- **XI 3.0 SP28**
- **XI 7.00 SP25**
- **XI 7.01 SP10**
- **XI 7.02 SP08**
- **PI 7.10 SP13**
- **PI 7.11 SP08**
- **PI 7.30 SP03**

For older Support Packages, the correction is available as a patch. Update the software components of the Adapter Engine to the patch levels maintained in the "SP Patch Level" section of this note or use newer versions. The archives and the support package stack guide can be found on the [SAP Service Marketplace](https://me.sap.com/) as described in [SAP Note 952402](https://me.sap.com/notes/952402).
