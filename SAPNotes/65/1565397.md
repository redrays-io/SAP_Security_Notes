**SAP Security Note 1565397 - Unauthorized modification of content in BSP DSWP_URL_LAUNCH**

**Release Date:** May 10, 2011  
**Priority:** Correction with High Priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** SV-SMG-ADM  
**Software Versions Affected:** ST 400, ST 710

### Symptom
The BSP application `DSWP_URL_LAUNCH` can be exploited by malicious users to modify displayed application content without authorization. Additionally, attackers may obtain authentication information from legitimate users, potentially leading to unauthorized access and impersonation.

### Technical Details
The `start.htm` page within the BSP application `DSWP_URL_LAUNCH` does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability. This flaw allows attackers to:
- Deface or modify web content displayed by the application temporarily.
- Steal authentication information, enabling impersonation of legitimate users, including administrators, which can compromise the entire application's security.

### Solution
1. **Deactivate the Vulnerable Service:**
   - If the BSP application `DSWP_URL_LAUNCH` is active in your system, deactivate it using transaction `SICF`. This service is not required for standard operations.
  
2. **Implement Corrections:**
   - Apply the provided correction instructions to ensure that the service remains deactivated, even if accidentally reactivated.
   - Download the correction instructions from the [Download for SNOTE](https://me.sap.com/notes/0040000009286162017).
