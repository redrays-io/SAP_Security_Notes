**Title:** 1615093 - Directory traversal in IS-H-CM

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 6  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Release Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.11.2011  
**Language:** English

**Component:** Industry-Specific Components > Hospital > Communication (IS-H-CM)

### Symptom
Potential directory traversal in the following components: IS-H-CM

### Other Terms
- Directory traversal
- IS-H-CM
- Healthcare

### Reason and Prerequisites
The programs specified in the correction instructions contain vulnerabilities that allow a malicious user to:
- **Read arbitrary files** on the remote server, potentially disclosing confidential information.
- **Write arbitrary files** on the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

### Solution
Refer to [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) and [Note 1607749](https://me.sap.com/notes/1607749). The corrections contained in these notes are prerequisites for this note.

**Logical file names used in this solution:**
- RNC301C3
- RNC301H3
- RNC302C0
- RNC301CHECKDATACOLLPOINTS

**Recommendations for setting up logical file names:**
To avoid maintaining a high number of logical file names, some programs share the same logical file name. This creates dependencies among these programs. To securely separate data created by different users and programs, create a directory structure that reflects the user name and/or program name, and use this information when setting up the physical path and file names for the logical file paths and file names.
