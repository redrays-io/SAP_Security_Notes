1615478 - Security: XSS vulnerability in SAP GUI for HTML

**Symptom**

SAP GUI for HTML can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, ITS, SAP Internet Transaction Server

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages within SAP GUI for HTML do not sufficiently encode INPUT and OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.
Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

An SAP (integrated) ITS patch/an SAP_BASIS Support Package corrects this error.

- **SAP ITS 6.20:** The section "SP Patch Level" contains information about which patch contains the relevant correction.
- **SAP integrated ITS (SAP kernel patches):** The section "SP Patch Level" contains information about which DW.SAR patch contains the relevant correction.
- **SAP integrated ITS (Support Packages):** The section "Support Packages" contains information about which SAP_BASIS Support Package contains the relevant correction.

To correct the error, apply the specified patch or a higher patch (patches are cumulative), or import the specified Support Package.

If the section "SP Patch Level" is missing, or if no information is available about which patch/Support Package contains the correction, this means that it is not yet available. In this case, consult this note again at a later stage.
