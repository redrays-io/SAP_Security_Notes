### Symptom
Potential Directory Traversal in Component XX-CSC-JP.

**Other Terms:** Path Traversal

### Reason and Prerequisites
1. The programs contained in the correction instructions have vulnerabilities that allow a malicious user to potentially read arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly disclosing confidential information.
2. Some of these programs also allow a malicious user to potentially write arbitrary files on the remote server, which could corrupt data or alter system behavior.

### Solution
Apply the relevant Support Package for your Release and refer to [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from Note 1497003 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.

The solution uses the existing logical file name `ISJP_INVSUM` to validate physical file names in the format `/tmp/INVSUM<DATE>_<TIME>`, utilized by program `ISJPINVSUM20_FORMS`.

**Important:** You must maintain the physical path to the file manually, following the manual correction instructions provided.
