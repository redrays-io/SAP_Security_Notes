**SAP Security Note 1615788**

**Title:** Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CA_GTF_PCF  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 13.12.2011  
**Component:** Cross-Application Components > General Application Functions > People Centric UI Framework  

### Description

#### Symptom
Some of the BSP pages in software components SAP_ABA can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting, XSS, WEBCUIF, CRMUIF.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The pages and methods listed within software components SAP_ABA do not sufficiently encode INPUT/OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Additionally, it can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data could impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, a full compromise of the application's security may occur.

#### Solution
Please implement the corrections attached to this note.
