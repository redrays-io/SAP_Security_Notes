**Status:** Released for Customer

**Component:** BC-CTS-CMS (Change and Transport System > Change Management Service)

### Description

#### Symptom
Problems with cross-site scripting might exist in CMS (Change Management Service) of NWDI (NetWeaver Development Infrastructure).

CMS of NWDI can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
NWDI DevInf page might result in a stored cross-site scripting issue.  
It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the malicious user to embed content that is rendered automatically, without targeting victims individually.  
Stored cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session.  
A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

#### Solution
Apply the patch attached to this note which matches the release and SP level of your AS Java hosting CMS.
