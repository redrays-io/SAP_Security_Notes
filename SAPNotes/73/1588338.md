**SAP Security Note 1588338 - Phishing in BSP component "system"**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 5  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer on 21.08.2013  
**Component:** Basis Components > Business Server Pages (BC-BSP)

### Description

#### Symptom
The BSP service system can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS), BSP

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within the ITS do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross site scripting issue. A reflected cross site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Additionally, it can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. In the case of an administrator being impersonated, a full compromise of the application's security may occur.

### Solution
Please apply for release 7.31 SP02.
