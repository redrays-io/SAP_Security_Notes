**SAP Security Note 1588736 - XSRF in BSP Pages (DEV)**

**Release Date:** November 8, 2011  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 5  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** Basis Components > SAP NetWeaver Mobile Infrastructure > Release 2.5 and 7.0

### **Symptom**
An attacker can execute functions in BC-MOB-MI without authentication and authorization.

### **Other Terms**
Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF), Mobile Infrastructure, MI 2.5, 7.0, 7.01, 7.02, 7.11, 7.10, 731.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
BC-MOB-MI executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user’s browser into making a request containing a specific URL and parameters, the function is executed with the user's rights. This can be achieved through cross-site scripting attacks or by presenting a malicious link to the victim.
