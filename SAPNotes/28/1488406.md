1488406 - Handling the generated user TMSADM

**Symptom**
This note addresses the prevention of misuse of the user account TMSADM.

**Other Terms**
- Transport Management System security

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The user account TMSADM is essential for the Transport Management System (TMS) as it facilitates the communication infrastructure. During the configuration of the TMS in client 000 of each involved system, this account is created with a fixed password, allowing read access to TMS-provided information, including transport directory contents.

**Solution**
1. **Implement the New Standard Password (Release 4.6C and later)**
   - Utilize the new standard password introduced in Release 4.6C to ensure TMSADM complies with complex password rules. The password length remains 8 characters for compatibility reasons. Refer to [Note 761637](https://me.sap.com/notes/761637) for more details.

2. **Define a Custom TMSADM Password**
   - **2.1.** Avoid linking systems of different releases permanently via TMS to prevent issues with custom TMSADM passwords. Place systems with the same release in separate TMS domains. See [Note 1023437](https://me.sap.com/notes/1023437) for guidance.
   - **2.2.** Define a unique password for the TMSADM account across your TMS landscape. Detailed prerequisites and procedures are provided in [Note 761637](https://me.sap.com/notes/761637).
   - **2.3.** Utilize the available help tool for large landscapes without domain links to streamline the password change process, as described in [Note 1414256](https://me.sap.com/notes/1414256). Alternatively, use external systems for occasional transport request exchanges between domains.

**Important**
If you have systems running a release lower than 4.6C, segregate them into separate TMS domains and lock the TMSADM account. For further information, refer to [Note 1486759](https://me.sap.com/notes/1486759).
