### Description

#### Symptom
Transaction GENC contains a branch to the ABAP Editor for reports generated in this transaction, which may enable a malicious user to inject and execute program code of the user's choice.

#### Other Terms
Code injection

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The program contains instructions that enable a user to execute code of the user's choice, which changes the system's behavior. In this case, the user must be logged on to the system with a valid access.

Depending on the code that the user injects, the user may obtain additional information to which no actual access was granted. The user may also be able to modify data, delete data, modify the output of the system, or create new users with higher privileges. The availability of the system is still endangered.

### Solution
By implementing the corrections, transaction GENC is no longer executed in the production environment.
