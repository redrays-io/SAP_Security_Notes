1489456 - Security Note: Buffer overflow in component shh.exe

## Description

A security hole was detected in the SAP GUI component `shh.exe`. It enables malicious users to cause a buffer overflow, insert their own commands into the memory area of the running process, and execute them. Additionally, the program may terminate if a memory protection violation is triggered. This means that harmful code can be executed on the front end where `shh.exe` is installed.

This file is part of the SAP GUI for Windows delivery. As a result, all front ends with SAP GUI for Windows implemented are affected.

## Other Terms

SAP GUI, shh.exe, SAP HTML Help, security, buffer overflow, application help, DynamicHelp, PlainHtmlHttp, PlainHtmlFile, HtmlHelpFile

## Reason and Prerequisites

The aforementioned symptoms were identified in the following versions of the `shh.exe` file ("SAP HTML Help") located in the installation directory of SAP GUI (`\SAPgui\htmlhelp`):

- **SAP GUI 6.20:** up to Version 7.1.0.5
- **SAP GUI 7.10:** up to Version 7.1.0.6
- **SAP GUI 7.20:** up to Version 7.2.0.6

## Solution

### SAP GUI 6.20:
A correction in this version is not possible (see [Note 929300](https://me.sap.com/notes/929300)). Perform an upgrade to SAP GUI 7.10 or higher.

### SAP GUI 7.10:
To address the security hole in `shh.exe`, it is strongly recommended to apply SAP GUI patch 19 or higher on each front end where SAP GUI is installed.

### SAP GUI 7.20:
To fix the security hole in `shh.exe`, it is strongly recommended to apply SAP GUI patch 2 or higher on each front end where SAP GUI is installed.

After installing the SAP GUI patch, verify the version of the `shh.exe` file. The `\SAPgui\htmlhelp` directory must contain a file with a version higher than those specified in the "Reason and Prerequisites" section.
