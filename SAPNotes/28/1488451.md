1488451 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in CRM ICSS

### Description

**Symptom**

This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see [Security Note 1698575](https://me.sap.com/notes/1698575).

The `ICSS_CONSUM_REG` can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify application content and persist the modified content without authorization. This can potentially lead to obtaining authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

CRM; ISE; ICSS; BSP; ICSS_CONSUM_REG; Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The `Default.htm` BSP page of BSP-Application: `ICSS_CONSUM_REG` results in a stored cross site scripting (XSS) issue. This vulnerability can be exploited to permanently modify displayed content on a website, enabling malicious users to embed content that is rendered automatically without the need to individually target victims.

Stored XSS can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. In the case of an administrator being impersonated, a full compromise of the application's security may occur.

**Solution**

The solution is available as of release CRM 7.01 SP2 in the standard. To correct the problem in earlier versions, apply the corrections of this [note](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001488451/63).
