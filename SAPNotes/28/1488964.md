SAP Security Note 1488964 - Potential disclosure of persisted data in BW-BCT-ISR-PIP

**SAP Security Note 1488964 - Potential disclosure of persisted data in BW-BCT-ISR-PIP**

**Description**

### Symptom
A malicious user can exploit BW-BCT-ISR-PIP (test report `/RTF/TEST_KTRF`) and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, resulting in the retrieval of additional information persisted by the system.

### Other Terms
- SQL injection
- Database
- BW-BCT-ISR-PIP

### Reason and Prerequisites
The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by a malicious user. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to retrieve data from the database.

### Solution
Implement the correction as described in the [correction instructions](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001488964/384).

After applying the correction, the test report `/RTF/TEST_KTRF` will exit immediately without any further processing. If you want to use this functionality further, copy the report and modify it according to your needs.
