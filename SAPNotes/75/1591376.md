SAP Security Note 1591376 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CRM IPC

**Note Number:** 1591376  
**Title:** Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CRM IPC  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** July 10, 2012  
**Component:** CRM-BF-CFG (Customer Relationship Management > Basic Functions > Product Configuration)

**Description:**

**Symptom**

Components associated with pricing and configuration can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), IPC, Mobile Sales (MSA), product configuration, Internet Sales (ISA), Config UI, CRM Online

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Components associated with pricing and configuration do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a web site. Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another userâ€™s authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
