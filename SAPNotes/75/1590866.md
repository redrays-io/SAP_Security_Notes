### Symptom
The BC-MOB-MI can be abused by a malicious user allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### CVSS Information
**CVSS Base Score:** 4.3  
**Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Reason and Prerequisites
Trace page within the BC-MOB-MI do not sufficiently encode URL parameters, resulting in a reflected cross site scripting issue. A reflected cross site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.  
Reflected cross site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use this to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. In case of an administrator being impersonated, a full compromise of the application's security may occur.

### Solution
The issue has been fixed. To get the correction, please upgrade your MI Webconsole to at least the patch level specified in the "Support Package Patches" section of this note, as relevant to your release and Support Package.
