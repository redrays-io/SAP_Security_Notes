1591024 - Unauthorized use of application functions in BC-SRV-SSF

**Symptom**
A malicious user can execute functions in BC-SRV-SSF without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
Cross-site request forgery, XSRF, BC-SRV-SSF

**Reason and Prerequisites**
BC-SRV-SSF executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The malicious user may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

**Solution**
Implement the corrections using the Note Assistant or import the relevant Support Package. If you use the Note Assistant to implement this note, note the following:

1. For additional information and instructions, see [Note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001520324). The corrections from Note 1520324 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.
2. Implement the attached correction instructions. Create the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_SSF` as a local object in your system.
3. Execute the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_SSF` and when requested, specify a relevant transport request number. The report will fill the database table `BSPTEMPXSRFSTORE` with relevant table entries for the BSP applications adapted by this note.
