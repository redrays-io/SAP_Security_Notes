1591040 - Security Verdict in SAUD RSGENLOAD

**Symptom**
A program in Package SAUD contains a vulnerability through which a malicious user can potentially read arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly impacting the system behaviour.

**Other Terms**
Directory traversal, SAUD

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The program fails to correctly validate the path that is used to reference a file that is read from the remote server. The content is copied into an internal table which then triggers report load generation. As a result, a malicious user with sufficient authorization to execute programs can direct the program to an arbitrary other file in the system, with possible negative impact on the system behaviour.
