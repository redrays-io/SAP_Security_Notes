**SAP Note/KBA:** 1599072  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 1  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 09.08.2011  
**Component:** Real Estate Management > Basic Data (RE-BD)  
**Title:** Directory traversal in RE-BD

### Symptom
RE-BD contains a vulnerability through which a malicious user can potentially write arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

### Other Terms
Directory traversal, RE-BD

### Reason and Prerequisites
RE-BD fails to correctly validate the path to which a user-submitted file is written. As a result, a malicious user can potentially overwrite data in the remote system.

### Solution
The programs contained in the correction instructions are used in RE-BD (RE-Classic) for legacy data transfer. As RE-Classic is an old product (see also note [443311](https://me.sap.com/notes/443311)) for which the successor product RE-FX exists, we decided to remove the critical coding inside the programs contained in the correction instructions. After implementing the correction, the programs do not work any longer. If you use these programs nevertheless, please submit a customer message under subject area RE-BD with reference to this note.
