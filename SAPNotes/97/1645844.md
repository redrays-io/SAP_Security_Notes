```markdown
**SAP Security Note 1645844**: *PI SEC: Missing Authorization Check in Integration Builder*

**Release Date**: August 14, 2012  
**Priority**: Correction with medium priority  
**Status**: Released for Customer  
**Component**: Basis Components > NetWeaver Process Integration (PI) > Integration Builder - Configuration

### **Symptom**
An authenticated user can access functions of the Integration Builder Directory that should be restricted, potentially leading to an escalation of privileges.

### **Reason**
The Integration Builder Directory lacks necessary authorization checks to verify a user's permissions when accessing certain functions, which may result in undesired system behavior.

### **Solution**
Update your XI/PI System to the recommended versions and patch levels specified in this note. This update includes the necessary authorization checks to secure the Integration Builder Directory.

### **Manual Activities**
After applying the fix, assign the role `SAP_XI_CONFIG_FILE_OS_CMD` to users who need to configure file adapter channels in the Integration Directory. If the ABAP role does not exist in your system, create it manually using transaction PFCG by performing the following steps:
1. **Create Role `SAP_XI_CONFIG_FILE_OS_CMD_J2EE`**:  
   - Create this as a single role without any authorizations.
2. **Create Role `SAP_XI_CONFIG_FILE_OS_CMD`**:  
   - Create this as a composite role that includes the `SAP_XI_CONFIG_FILE_OS_CMD_J2EE` role.
