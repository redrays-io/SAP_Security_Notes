SAP Security Note 1644896 - Missing authorization check in SAP NetWeaver BPM Task Management

**Description**

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can receive delegated tasks of SAP NetWeaver BPM Task Management to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
SAP NetWeaver BPM Task Management does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to receive delegated tasks. This oversight may lead to undesired system behavior.

**Solution**
By applying the correction contained in one of the Support Packages listed below, the behavior of the UME Principal Selector Dialog used in the context of SAP NetWeaver BPM Task Management will be changed as follows:
- The dialog will only return UME users that belong to the "BPEM End User" role (unique name: "pcd:portal_content/com.sap.pct/every_user/com.sap.bpem/com.sap.bpem.roles/com.sap.bpem.Enduser"). This role will be added as an implicit, additional search criterion.
- As a result, it will no longer be possible to delegate SAP NetWeaver BPM Tasks to any UME user outside of this role.

**Components Affected**
- **BPEM-WDUI**
- **BPEM-HIM**
- **BPEM-MON**
- **BPEM NWA PLUG INS**
- **BPEM WEBDYNPRO UIS**
- **BPEM HUMAN INTERFACE MGMT**
