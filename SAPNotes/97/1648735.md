### Title

### Description

#### Symptom
The Function Group **SDATA**, present in the package **SDIR**, which accesses the database tables violates authorization checks.

SDATA, FM, SDIR

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The Function Group, which has access to database tables, does not have any authorization checks.

#### Solution
The solution for the issue is to comment out the complete Function Group **SDATA**, which is present in the package **SDIR**, as it was just experimental. Neither it is documented nor it is released for reuse.

**Note:**
