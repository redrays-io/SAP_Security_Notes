# Cross-Frame Scripting Protection in SAP Logon Application

**SAP Note Number:** 1651004  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 4  
**Released On:** 28.03.2013  
**Priority:** HotNews  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** Basis Components > NetWeaver Application Server Java > Security, User Management

## Symptom
This security note addresses a vulnerability where the SAP logon application can be abused by an attacker. This allows unauthorized access to data entered by a legitimate user across different pages of the logon application.

## Other Terms
- **Cross-frame scripting (XFS)**
- **Logon application**

## Reason and Prerequisites
Cross-frame scripting (XFS) exploits browser vulnerabilities to access information entered manually by users on web pages. Although the Web AS Java is not directly vulnerable to XFS attacks, it is recommended to implement additional defenses in web applications as a precautionary measure. The impact of XFS attacks on SAP systems is considered low to moderate, primarily because most supported browsers have addressed this vulnerability.

## Solution
1. **Apply Latest Patches:**
   Ensure that you apply the latest patches relevant to your Web AS Java release as outlined in the Patch Level section of this note. You can download the necessary patches [here](https://me.sap.com/notes/0040000017340692017).

2. **Configure UME Property:**
   Update the UME property `login.block_ext_logon_app_embedding` to `true` to enhance protection against XFS attacks.
