SAP Security Note 1650819 - Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) in GTS Dashboard possible

**Description:**
The GTS Customs Management Dashboard can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Symptom:**
An attacker can manipulate the GTS Customs Management Dashboard to alter displayed content without proper authorization. This vulnerability can be exploited to steal authentication information from legitimate users, potentially allowing the attacker to impersonate users and access sensitive information.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
Output parameters are not sufficiently encoded, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a website. Additionally, it can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as session data. If an administrator's credentials are compromised, the security of the entire application may be fully compromised.

**Solution:**
Implement the specified source code changes by following the relevant correction instructions provided in this SAP Note. Ensure that all output parameters are properly encoded to prevent unauthorized modification of application content and protect user authentication information.
