### Description

**Symptom**

SAP Business Client allows, in very specific situations, the loading of configuration files from untrusted sources. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to advanced attacks, including:

- **Phishing attacks** to steal credentials of the victim.
- **Redirecting users** to untrusted webpages containing malware or similar malicious exploits.

**Solution**

If certificate errors occur when loading the SAP UI Landscape configuration files, SAP Business Client will, by default, no longer load the untrusted files as of the patch mentioned in this SAP Note. Instead, it will display error popups for the configuration files that could not be loaded.

SAP recommends maintaining valid certificates for your web servers. Additionally, SAP Business Client and SAP GUI for Windows offer a mechanism to whitelist specific web servers for loading the SAP UI Landscape configuration files. Detailed instructions on setting up such a whitelist can be found in [SAP Note 2892419](https://me.sap.com/notes/2892419).
