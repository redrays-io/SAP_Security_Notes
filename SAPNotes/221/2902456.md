2902456 - [CVE-2020-6236] Privilege Escalation in SAP Landscape Management (SAP Adaptive Extensions)

**Symptom**

**UPDATE 23rd September 2020**: This note has been re-released with updated ‘Support Packages & Patches’ information. We added the patch 000053 for the component SAP ADAPTIVE EXTENSIONS 1.0

An attacker with `admin_group` privileges could change ownership and permissions of arbitrary files remotely. This results in the possibility to execute these files as the root user from a non-root context.

In combination with other typically available remote functions on SAP systems, one may change ownership and permissions to execute arbitrary commands on the target system as the root user.

**Other Terms**

LaMa, Landscape Management, SAP Host Agent, operations.d, SAPACEXT, SAP Adaptive Extensions, SAPACOSPrep, ASUIOperation, [CVE-2020-6236](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2020-6236)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

An attacker authenticates as a user registered in the `admin_group` against the SAP Host Agent (via SOAP/remotely) and SAP Landscape Management is installed with at least one managed host being configured.

*Note: Typical users in the `admin_group` are the `sapadm` user and the Diagnostics Agent user.*
