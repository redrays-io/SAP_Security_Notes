2903743 - Information Disclosure in SAP Landscape Management

**Symptom**

A disclosure vulnerability exists in the enterprise edition or standard edition of SAP Landscape Management that allows an authenticated user with high privileges to obtain privileged access to other systems, making those systems vulnerable to information disclosure and modification.

The information disclosed includes credentials. To fix the problem, follow these steps:

1. Implement [SAP Landscape Management 3.0 SP14 Patch02](https://me.sap.com/notes/2908487).
2. Remove all SAP NetWeaver Developer Traces and archives of traces with severity Path or higher.
3. Change the affected credentials because the logs could have already been read.
