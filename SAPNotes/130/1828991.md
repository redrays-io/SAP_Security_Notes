**SAP Note:** 1828991  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.10.2013  
**Component:** Basis Components > NetWeaver Process Integration (PI) > Integration Server > Runtime Workbench / Monitoring

### Description

**Symptom**  
PI Runtime Workbench (RWB) can be abused by attackers, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
Web pages within 'Process Integration Runtime Workbench' do not sufficiently encode URL parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**  
This issue is fixed with the Support Packages and Patches of the Software Components referenced by this note in the section 'SP Patch Level'.
