1823566 - Potential information disclosure relating to SolutionManager

**Symptom**

An attacker can discover information relating to passwords who uses SAP Solution Manager.  
This information could be used to allow the attacker to specialize their attacks against server information and processes and the SAP database.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.0  
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N  

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Other Terms**

Information disclosure, SAP Solution Manager, DB Interface, DB Administrator

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Information such as the landscape configuration data and database user passwords can be discovered using SAP Solution Manager.  
This information may be used by an attacker to further target SAP database.  
Note that the user and password for database connections created in old versions of SAP Solution Manager are stored in table DBCON instead of separation of the user and connection information apart from the password. These information is kept and may have been residing in your system for ages.

**Solution**

The correction provided by this note migrates database connection information created by old versions of SAP Solution Manager into the new storage model, i.e., separation of user and connection information apart from password.  
The solution requires a specific kernel (disp+work) patch level and ABAP support package. Please apply the levels as mentioned in this note; for ABAP you may apply the correction instruction instead.  
After the implementation, you have to execute report `RS_DBC_CLEANUP`, which performs the migration. For the execution of this report the authorization `S_RZL_ADM` with `ACTVT = '01'` is needed.
