1826123 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in web tier

---

**Symptom**

BI4 Web application can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score**: 3.5
- **CVSS Base Vector**: AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:N/I:P/A:N

**Other Terms**

- Stored cross-site scripting, XSS, BI web application

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages result in a stored cross-site scripting issue. It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the attacker to embed content that is rendered automatically, without the attacker having to target victims individually. Stored cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Install BI4 Patch 5.5 or Support Pack 6.
