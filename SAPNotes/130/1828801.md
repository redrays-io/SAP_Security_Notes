SAP Security Note 1828801 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in SV-SMG-DIA-SRV

**Title:** 1828801 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in SV-SMG-DIA-SRV

**Description:**
Solution Manager internal support tools can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Symptom:**
An attacker can exploit certain Solution Manager servlet-based pages that do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. This can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a web site and steal user authentication information.

**CVSS Information:**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

_SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note._

**Other Terms:**
- Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
Certain Solution Manager servlet-based pages fail to adequately encode input parameters, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability. An attacker can use this to steal another user's authentication information, such as session data, enabling them to impersonate the user and access information with the same privileges.

**Solution:**
The potential threat has been addressed and fixed with Solution Manager 7.1 SP05.
