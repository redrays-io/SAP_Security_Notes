SAP Security Note 2058934: Switchable Authorization Checks for RFC in LE-WM

---

## Overview

SAP has released **Security Note [2058934](https://me.sap.com/notes/2058934)**, which introduces **switchable authorization checks** for RFC function modules in **LE-WM (Warehouse Management)**. This enhancement aims to strengthen system security by ensuring that remote function calls are properly authorized.

## Key Features

- **New Authorization Scenarios**: Two new authorization scenarios, `LE_WMS_DEC_CEN_CHECK` and `LE_WM_IDOCMON_RFC`, have been implemented to provide granular authorization checks.
- **Activation via SACF**: The authorization checks are delivered inactive to maintain compatibility. They can be activated manually using transaction **SACF**.
- **Enhanced Security**: Ensures that only users with the necessary authorizations can execute specific RFC function modules, reducing potential security risks.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Download Attachment Files**:
   - [LE_WMS_DEC_CEN_CHECK.TXT](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012006153200001186872014&iv_version=0001&iv_guid=E281B87CB5330D428500974F76587D3E)
   - [LE_WM_IDOCMON_RFC.TXT](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012006153200001186872014&iv_version=0001&iv_guid=495128976EBF44448E04946BB9A88D2A)

2. **Upload Scenario Definitions**:
   - Start transaction **SACF_TRANSFER**.
   - Select **Upload**, choose **Scenario Definition**, and execute.
   - Upload the downloaded `.TXT` files and assign them to the development package **LVS**.

3. **Create Productive Authorization Scenarios**:
   - In transaction **SACF**, convert the scenario definitions into productive scenarios.
   - Set the initial status to **Active** or **Logging** based on your requirements.

4. **Activate Security Audit Log**:
   - Ensure that the **Security Audit Log** is active by checking in transaction **SM19**.
   - Configure relevant audit message filters to monitor authorization checks.

5. **Adjust User Roles**:
   - Update user roles to include the new authorization objects.
   - Use report **RSAU_SELECT_EVENTS** to identify users needing additional authorizations.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that your system is running on compatible **SAP_APPL** release versions (600, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 616, 617).
- Apply relevant **Support Packages** as listed in the Security Note to ensure compatibility.
