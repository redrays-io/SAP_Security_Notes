2059230 - Authorization checks for RFC in E-Recruiting

**SAP Security Note 2059230** addresses new authorization checks for RFC function modules in the E-Recruiting component to enhance system security.

### Symptom
Remote calls to RFC function modules were previously protected by the authorization object `S_RFC`. However, it was identified that these checks might not suffice to ensure secure execution for certain RFC function modules within E-Recruiting.

### Solution
The security note implements additional authorization checks using existing authorization objects. Administrators should apply the attached correction instructions to ensure that authorizations for `S_RFC` are limited to the minimum necessary for all users.

**Affected RFC Function Module:**
- `HRRCF_MDL_ADMN_CHECK_EXT_CAND`

### Components and Versions
- **Component:** Personnel Management > E-Recruiting (PA-ER)
- **Supported Versions:** 600, 603, 604, 605, 606, 616, 617, 800, 801, 802

### Installation
Apply the correction instructions provided in the note to implement the enhanced authorization checks. Ensure that all relevant support packages are up to date:
