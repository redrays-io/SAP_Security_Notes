SAP Security Note 2057196 - Missing Authorization Check in IS-B-BCA-AM

**Symptom**
Account Management does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in escalation of privileges. This oversight can lead to:
- Abuse of functionality restricted to specific user groups
- Unauthorized read, modification, or deletion of restricted data

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The Account Management module lacks authorization checks to verify an authenticated user's permissions for accessing certain functions. This missing check may cause undesired system behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

**Solution**
The affected functions have been updated to enforce proper access restrictions. To resolve this issue:
1. **Implement Correction Instructions**: Follow the correction instructions provided in the note.
