445892 - Security gap in mass maintenance

**Summary**

SAP Security Note 445892 addresses a security gap in the mass maintenance functionality. Despite the installation of the advanced correction from Note 304394, the system fails to query authorization `S_DEVELOP` in the new MASS interface introduced in Release 4.6 and later. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to ABAP source code during mass maintenance operations.

**Symptom**

When using the mass maintenance feature with ABAP form routines to make changes or display data, the system does not perform an authorization check for `S_DEVELOP` after applying the advanced correction from Note 304394. This issue persists in the new MASS interface starting from Release 4.6.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The problem stems from a gap in Note 304394, which only closes the security gap in the mass maintenance for the old MASS interface available up to Release 4.5B. The new MASS interface introduced in Release 4.6 requires implementing the `AUTHORITY-CHECK` at a different program location to ensure proper authorization.

**Solution**

Implement the advanced correction provided in this security note. After applying the correction, the system will correctly query authorization `S_DEVELOP` for the entry of ABAP source code in the mass maintenance process.

**Recommendation**

Develop ABAP source code for mass maintenance of field values exclusively in the development client with appropriate development authorization. Store the code as a variant, which can then be transported to the production client using the transactions mentioned in [Note 500653](https://me.sap.com/notes/500653). In the production environment, users without development authorization can execute the transported variant.
