### Symptom
Customer has questions regarding reports about the potential SAP Virus "SAPvir".

### Other Terms
virus, worm, VSoft.A, SAP.Willi.A, ABAP/Rivpas

### Reason and Prerequisites

### Solution
Reports from April 16, 2002, state that a so-called virus for SAP Systems has been published. The corresponding code is referred to as SAPvir.

The source for this virus is a study; the corresponding coding that would be used to infect other programs or function modules, as well as the exemplary damaging functions, have been deactivated. The virus can only be spread to other systems by intentionally or unintentionally transporting and executing the code in the target system. By replacing the exemplary coding, a malicious user could use this virus to crash the system, modify data, or make changes that could result in data loss. Currently, we do not know of any cases where SAP customers have been infected with this or any similar virus.

As described in the [SAP Security Guide](http://service.sap.com/securityguide), you should divide your system landscape into three separate systems: a development system, a quality assurance system, and your productive system. These systems should be configured so that any changes to the configuration or ABAP programs can only take place in the development system. Therefore, to implement this virus, a user must be able to modify ABAP programs. This requires the necessary development authorizations, which should only be given to trustworthy developers. The SAP System itself creates change documents, transport logs, and version information so that any damaging actions performed by a developer can be traced back to the user. Additionally, all changes that are transported into the quality assurance and then further into the productive system should be carefully checked by qualified expert teams. These teams should also include detailed tests in the software checks.

You can recognize this virus by:
- Checking the last user who changed the program or function module
- Using a source code scan

This virus does not damage the infected program and can therefore be removed using automatic means.

In addition to the checks performed by the Quality Assurance experts, you can also use virus scanners to search text files for known viruses (up to now, virus scanners cannot search in transport files). The most commonly used virus scanners are able to recognize SAPvir. Do note, however, that the use of these virus scanners can lead to a false sense of security because most virus scanning software typically only recognize viruses or malicious code sequences that are already known as such.
