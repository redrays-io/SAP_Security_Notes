517484 - Inactive services in the Internet Communication Framework

**SAP Note 517484 - Inactive services in the Internet Communication Framework**

**Symptom**

After installing the SAP Web Application Server, the Internet Communication Framework (ICF) services are inactive, resulting in errors such as "Forbidden" in the browser. For example, testing a web service using transaction `WSADMIN` may display the error:

```
Could not determine WSDL address (ICF_ERROR), SRT_REG038
```

**Cause**

This behavior is intentional for security reasons. Upon installation, all ICF services are set to inactive. Administrators must manually activate the necessary services based on the application's requirements.

**Solution**

To resolve the issue, activate the required ICF services using transaction code `SICF`. Follow these steps:

1. **Open Transaction SICF**
   
   Log into your SAP system and enter transaction code `SICF`.

2. **Navigate to the Relevant Service Node**

   For example, to activate services for the `/SAP/public/icman` URL:
   
   - Expand the tree to locate the `default_host` service.
   - Within `default_host`, navigate to `sap` > `public` > `icman`.

3. **Activate the Service**

   - **Method 1:** 
     - Right-click on the desired service node.
     - Select **Activate Service** from the context menu.
   
   - **Method 2:** 
     - Select the service node.
     - Go to the menu and choose **Service** > **Activate**.

4. **Repeat as Necessary**

   Ensure that all parent nodes in the ICF tree are activated to prevent unexpected errors. Activate any additional services required for your specific operational scenario.
