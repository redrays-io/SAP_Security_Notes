### Description

The standard configuration does not allow managing the SAProuter from an external host for security reasons. This note explains how to enable certain operations such as stopping the SAProuter, reimporting route permission tables, switching trace levels, terminating connections, and more by using specific options.

**Important Security Consideration:** Enabling external management using the `-X` option allows external clients to control the SAProuter, which may expose your system to potential security risks. SAP recommends not using this option unless necessary and ensuring proper security measures are in place.

### Solution

To permit connections to the SAProuter from external hosts, use the SAProuter start option `-X`:

```
-X
```

**Note:** Using the `-X` option may compromise system security. SAP recommends against its use unless absolutely necessary.
