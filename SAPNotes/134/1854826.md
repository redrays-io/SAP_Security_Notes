SAP Security Note 1854826 - Potential information disclosure for NetWeaver web sessions

## Description

### Symptom
An attacker can discover information relating to NetWeaver browser sessions (cookies) that is used to identify and authenticate the user. The information an attacker can get does not enable access to an affected NetWeaver system directly, but it would help in other attacks, e.g., to verify user/password combinations.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3

### Other Terms

### Reason and Prerequisites
