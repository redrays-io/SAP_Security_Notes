1641116 - Forums application is vulnerable to CSRF attack

**Symptom**

An attacker can execute functions in the forums application without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), XSRF, forums

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The forums application executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a specific URL and parameters, the function is executed using the user's rights. This can be achieved through a cross-site scripting attack or by presenting a malicious link to the victim.
