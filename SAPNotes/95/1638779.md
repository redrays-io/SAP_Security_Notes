SAP Security Note 1638779: Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in BSP Pages

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** December 13, 2012  
**SAP Component:** BC-BSP (Basis Components > Business Server Pages)

## Description

BSP Extensions in the BC-BSP package are vulnerable to abuse by attackers, allowing unauthorized modification of displayed application content. This vulnerability can potentially enable attackers to obtain authentication information from legitimate users.

### Symptom

BSP extensions within BC-BSP fail to sufficiently encode output parameters, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Exploiting this issue allows attackers to:

- **Deface or Modify Content:** Temporarily alter the displayed content of a web application.
- **Steal Authentication Information:** Capture user authentication details, enabling impersonation of users, including administrators, which can compromise the entire application's security.

### Impact

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can:

- **Non-Permanently Deface Content:** Change the appearance or content of web pages without authorization.
- **Steal Authentication Data:** Gain access to sensitive information related to user sessions, allowing for unauthorized access and potential full compromise of the application if administrative accounts are targeted.

### Solution

Apply the relevant SAP Security Note using the SAP Note Assistant (SNOTE).
