1639131 - Unauthorized execution of application function in WDA

**Description**

### Symptom
An attacker can execute functions in Web Dynpro ABAP without authentication and authorization.

### Other Terms
Cross-site request forgery, XSRF, Web Dynpro ABAP

### Reason and Prerequisites
Web Dynpro ABAP executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated userâ€™s browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The attacker may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

### Solution
The attached correction instructions deactivate the affected functions in the Web Dynpro ABAP. They cannot be reactivated. The deactivated functions were purely meant for testing Web Dynpro ABAP applications and are not required for the production operation of Web Dynpro ABAP applications. As of Release 7.01 and 7.11, functions are available again for testing.
