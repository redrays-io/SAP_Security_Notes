1494303 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in IC Appl.

**SAP Security Note 1494303 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in IC Appl.**

**Description:**

### Symptom
The Interaction Center Web Client (ICWC) could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Stored Cross-Site Scripting, XSS, ICWC, CRM_IC, IC_BASE

### Reason and Prerequisites
Applications based out of IC_BASE such as CRM_IC could result in a stored/reflected cross-site scripting issue.

- Stored/reflected cross-site scripting can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the malicious user to embed content that is rendered automatically, without the need to individually target victims.
- Stored/reflected cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session.
- An attacker who gains access to this data could use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the application security could be fully compromised.

### Solution
Kindly implement the correction instruction as attached in the note.
