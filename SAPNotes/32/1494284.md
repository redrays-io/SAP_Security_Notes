1494284 - XSS:Unauthorized modification of stored content

## Description

### Symptom
The program could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Stored Cross-Site Scripting, XSS.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Stored cross-site scripting can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a web site, allowing the malicious user to embed content that is rendered automatically, without the need to individually target victims.
Stored cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session.
An attacker who gains access to this data could use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.

## Solution
Implement the corrections attached to the note.
