SAP Security Note 1495062 - Potential disclosure and modification of persisted data

**SAP Security Note 1495062** addresses a critical SQL injection vulnerability within the Schedule Manager supporting reports. This vulnerability allows malicious users to execute arbitrary database commands by manipulating input parameters, potentially leading to unauthorized data disclosure and modification.

### **Symptom**
A malicious user can exploit the Schedule Manager supporting reports and use specially crafted inputs to execute arbitrary database commands to retrieve the data persisted by the system.

### **Other Terms**
- Security
- Vulnerability
- SQL Injection
- Database

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The issue does not occur in the transactions SCMA or SCMO but only when using the supporting reports for access synchronization related to the Schedule Manager. The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability where the code composes an SQL statement including strings that can be altered by a malicious user. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to retrieve additional information from the database.

### **Solution**
The coding of the supporting reports has been commented out. If the functionality provided by these reports is required, it is necessary to create custom reports where no general solution for any database table is used. Instead, the database table should be hardcoded within the report. You can use the non-executable coding of the aforementioned reports as a template for creating your own report.
