### Symptom
A malicious user could abuse the ESRI Map to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The JavaScript API call to archweb services within the ESRI Map does not sufficiently encode input and output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This flaw allows attackers to:

- Deface or modify displayed content non-permanently.
- Steal another user's authentication information, potentially leading to impersonation and full compromise of the application's security.
