**SAP Security Note 1494203: Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in CRMCMP_PWP**

**Description**
The CRMCMP_PWP BSP application is vulnerable to unauthorized modifications by malicious users. This vulnerability allows attackers to alter displayed application content without proper authorization and potentially steal authentication information from legitimate users.

**Symptom**
A malicious user can exploit the CRMCMP_PWP application to modify content displayed in the application. This unauthorized modification can lead to the theft of authentication information, allowing attackers to impersonate users and access sensitive data.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

This deficiency results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to deface or modify website content and steal user authentication information.
