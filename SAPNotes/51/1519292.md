1519292 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in WPC

**Symptom**

Web Page Composer can be abused by a malicious user allowing them to modify application content, and persist the modified content without authorization and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

Stored Cross Site Scripting, XSS

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Program error resulting in a stored cross site scripting issue.
It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a web site, allowing the malicious user to embed content that is rendered automatically, without the need to individually target victims.
Stored cross site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information such as data relating to their current session.
An attacker who gains access to this data may use this to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. In case of an administrator being impersonated, a full compromise of the application's security may occur.

The solution is available in the following releases:
