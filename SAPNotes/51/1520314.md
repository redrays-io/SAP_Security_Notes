1520314 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BC-SRV-KPR

### Description

**SAP Note/KBA:** 1520314  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 12.01.2011  
**Component:** Basis Services/Communication Interfaces > Knowledge Provider (BC-SRV-KPR)

### Symptom

The BC-SRV-KPR-CMS can be exploited by malicious users to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability allows attackers to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Details

Pages within the BC-SRV-KPR-CMS do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a website. Additionally, attackers can steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session, which may be used to impersonate the user and access information with the same privileges. If an administrator is impersonated, it could lead to a full compromise of the application's security.

### Solution

To address this vulnerability, implement this SAP Note or import the relevant support package.
