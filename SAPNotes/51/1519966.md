### Description
A malicious user can exploit NWBC 3.0 SmartClient to gain complete control of the product, including viewing, changing, or deleting data.

**Other Terms**: Buffer overrun, RCE, NWBC

### Reason and Prerequisites
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in NWBC 3.0 SmartClient. This allows a malicious user to inject code into the working memory, which is subsequently executed by the application. It can also cause a general fault in the product, leading to its termination.

**Prerequisites**: User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

### Solution
