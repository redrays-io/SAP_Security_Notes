### Symptom
A malicious user can perform shared report operations to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Shared reports in DuetEnterprise 1.0 do not properly validate user inputs before performing shared report subscribe operations. This may result in undesired system behavior.

### Solution
Code changes are made to enforce the validity of operations on a Shared Report.
