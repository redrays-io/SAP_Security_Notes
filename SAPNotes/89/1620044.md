1620044 - KM UI vulnerable to CSRF attacks

**SAP Note Number:** 1620044  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** February 14, 2012

### Symptom
A malicious user can execute functions in KM UI without authentication and authorization.

### Other Terms
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), XSRF

### Reason and Prerequisites
KM UI executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs or via POST requests. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing certain URLs or executing a POST request with specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. This can be achieved through cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or by presenting a link to the victim.

### Solution
Refer to the Support Package patch level section of this SAP note for details.
