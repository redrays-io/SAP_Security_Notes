**SAP Security Note 1618864 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in RWB**

**Description**
A vulnerability has been identified in the Message Content display within the Runtime Workbench (RWB). A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability to modify application content without authorization, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
