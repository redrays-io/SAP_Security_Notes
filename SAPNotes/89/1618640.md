## Reason and Prerequisites
CRM-ISE-WBF, CRM-ISE-SRE, CRM-ISE-UAD execute certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The malicious user may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

1. Refer to [note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324) and [note 1551982](https://me.sap.com/notes/1551982) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from these notes are a prerequisite for implementing this note.
2. Implement the correction instructions of this note. This will also create the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_ISE_WBF` in your system.
3. Execute the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_ISE_WBF` and specify a corresponding transport request number when prompted. The report will activate the XSRF protection for the BSP applications adapted by this note.
