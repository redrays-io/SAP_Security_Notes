2771128 - [CVE-2019-0306] Information Disclosure in SAP HANA Extended Application Services (advanced model)

**Description**

### Symptom
Under certain conditions, the SAP HANA XS Advanced server allows platform users to access more information than required.

Some well-known impacts of Information Disclosure are:
- Loss of information and system configuration confidentiality
- Information gathering for further exploits and attacks

### Reason and Prerequisites
Authenticated, low-privileged XS Advanced platform users such as SpaceAuditors can execute requests to obtain a complete list of SAP HANA user IDs and names.

### Solution
The vulnerability has been fixed with SAP HANA Extended Application Services, advanced model version **1.0.115**. Apply this or later versions. After patching the system, user IDs and names of platform users will only be visible to administrative users or users of the same space or organization.

**Note:** The patch might cause malfunction of some user management commands in former versions of the XS client and XSA Cockpit. Hence, updating XSA Cockpit to at least version **1.1.12** and the XS client to at least version **1.0.114** might be required. Please find details in the [release notes of XS Advanced version 1.0.115](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sfm/notes/0002771128?language=en-US&token=D5A8A04CC9370833AAEC5C4047405D19).
