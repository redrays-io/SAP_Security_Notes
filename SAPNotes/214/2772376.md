2772376 - [CVE-2019-0284] XML External Entity vulnerability in SAP HANA sldreg

### Symptom
SLD Registration in SAP HANAâ€¯does not sufficiently validate an XML document accepted from an untrusted source.

Some well-known impacts of Missing XML Validation vulnerability are:
- Arbitrary file retrieval from the server
- Denial-of-service conditions in successful exploits

### Other Terms
**XXE**, XML input parsing, [CVE-2019-0284](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0284)

### Reason and Prerequisites
SLD Registration (SLDREG) is used by SAP HANA to register the SAP HANA system to the System Landscape Directory. An attacker can call SLDREG with an XML file containing a reference to an XML External Entity (XXE). This can cause SLDREG to, for example, continuously loop, read arbitrary files, and even send local files.

**Prerequisite:** An authenticated attacker must have local access to the SAP HANA server. SLDREG can then be executed, and arbitrary files/resources can be processed within the authorization scope of the authenticated attacker.

### Solution
SLDREG has been updated with the following SAP HANA revisions. Update to these or later versions:
- **122.24** for SAP HANA 1.00 SPS12
- **24.09** for SAP HANA 2.0, SPS02
- **37** for SAP HANA 2.0, SPS03

_SAP HANA 2.0 SPS04 is not affected._

### CVSS
**Score:** 5.1
