1170848 - Security note: HTTP request check tightened

**SAP Security Note 1170848** addresses a critical security enhancement related to the processing of HTTP requests in the SAP Internet Communication Manager (ICM) and SAP Web Dispatcher.

### Symptom
In certain circumstances, specially crafted HTTP requests may lead to incorrect processing of requests in the backend.

### Other Terms
HTTP, ICM, Web Dispatcher, security, patch

### Reason and Prerequisites
The system sends specially prepared HTTP requests to the application server while using an older kernel version. An attacker can exploit these security gaps to evade the filter functions of the ICM and SAP Web Dispatcher. However, the application server remains secure if third-party products for URL filtering are employed.

### Solution
The HTTP parser has been modified in the specified patch levels to recognize invalid requests at the kernel level, ensuring they are intercepted before reaching higher protocol layers. Apply the updates to the following kernel patch levels:

- **711 kernel patch level**: 0
- **710 kernel patch level**: 108
- **701 kernel patch level**: 8
- **700 kernel patch level**: 164
- **640 kernel patch level**: 237
