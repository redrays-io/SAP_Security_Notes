RTC, Real-Time Collaboration, instant messaging, chat, application sharing, RTMF, Real-Time Messaging Framework, Security Update.

### Reason and Prerequisites

The portal component - RTCAwarenessTest had a low safety security level and therefore could be accessed by a user that has no or low privileges.

### Solution

The problem has been solved for NW701 Enhancement Package 1, NW700 SP16, and NW04 SP23.
