1163694 - Correction of the user type for external candidates

**SAP Note/KBA:** 1163694  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 5  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** October 8, 2009  
**Component:** Personnel Management > E-Recruiting  
**Category:** Program error  
**Language:** English  

### Symptom
External candidates are created as dialog users for the logon when they are registered. As a result, if they know a user name and the application server, they can use SAP GUI to log on to the SAP E-Recruiting back-end system.

### Reason and Prerequisites
To enable the user switch from the anonymous user to the registered candidate, a user switch to a dialog user is required. The external candidate does not have sufficient authorization to change their user type after the user switch.

### Solution
1. **Import the Relevant Support Package**: Apply the appropriate support package provided with this note.
2. **Implement Correction Instructions**: Follow the correction instructions provided in the note.
3. **Create Text Symbols**: Add the following text symbols for the report `RCF_UPDATE_EXT_CANDIDATES`:
    ```
    001: "The user type of &1 candidates has been changed." (Max 100 characters)
    002: "No candidates whose user type has to be changed were found." (Max 100 characters)
    003: "Changing the user type of a candidate failed. Therefore, the process was terminated." (Max 132 characters)
    004: "Until then, the user type of &1 candidates has been changed." (Max 100 characters)
    005: "The following errors occurred:" (Max 50 characters)
    ```
4. **Execute the Report Periodically**: Run the report `RCF_UPDATE_EXT_CANDIDATES` regularly to update the user type of external candidates. Ensure the executing user has the necessary authorization to change users. In distributed scenarios, execute this report on both application servers.
