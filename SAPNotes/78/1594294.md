---

**Description**

This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see [Security Note 2178874](https://me.sap.com/notes/2178874).

Potential Directory Traversal in the following components: XX-CSC-AR.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

- The programs contained in the correction instructions contain vulnerabilities through which a malicious user can potentially read arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly disclosing confidential information.
- Some of the programs contained in the correction instructions contain a vulnerability through which a malicious user can potentially write arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

**Solution**

Please refer to [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from this note are a prerequisite for implementing this security note.

**Logical File Names Used in this Solution**

The following logical file names have been created to enable the validation of physical file names:
- FI_J1AF018_FILE
- FI_J1AF205_FILE
- FI_J1AF217_FILE

**Logical File Paths Used in this Solution**

The logical file names listed above use the logical file path FI_AR_FILE_PATH. The applications J_1AF205, J_1AF217, and J_1AF018 are passing an additional parameter `parameter_1` (sy-cprog) to the Function Module `FILE_VALIDATE_NAME`. This allows customers to insert the parameter while configuring the physical paths for the Logical File Name FI_AR_FILE_PATH.
