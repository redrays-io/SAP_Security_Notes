### **Description**

A malicious user can execute functions in CRM-MD-BP-CCP without authentication and authorization.

**Terms:**
- Cross-site request forgery (XSRF)
- CRM-MD-BP-CCP
- CRMD_ORDER_BP

### **Reason and Prerequisites**

CRM-MD-BP-CCP executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a specific URL and parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. This can be achieved via cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or by presenting a malicious link to the victim.

### **Solution**

Implement the attached correction instructions.

#### **Manual Activities**

1. Go to transaction **SE80** and select the application **CRM_BSP_CCKPT_SERVICE_HTTP**.
2. Navigate to the **Properties** tab and click on the **Display/Change** button.
3. Check the **XSRF protection** flag and save the changes.
4. Select the **loader.htm** file (inside the folder "Pages with Flow Logic").
5. In the **Properties** tab, check the **Start BSP** flag and save the changes.

*In case the BSP application needs to be unlocked, refer to [note 1038797](https://me.sap.com/notes/1038797).*
