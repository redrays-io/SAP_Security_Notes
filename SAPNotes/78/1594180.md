**Other Terms**  
- Memory corruption  
- MaxDB/liveCache

### Reason and Prerequisites

The issue is caused by a memory corruption that leads to process termination. A malicious user can induce a condition where the process attempts to read outside its memory space, causing a memory protection fault. As a result, the system terminates the process, rendering the application unusable until it is restarted manually.

### Solution

- 7.6.06 build 19
- 7.7.06 build 23
- 7.7.07 build 34
- 7.8.02 build 22
- 7.9.03 build 16
- 7.9.07 build 09

*Releases below 7.6 are not affected.*
