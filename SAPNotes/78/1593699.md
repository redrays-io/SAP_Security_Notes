1593699 - Unauthorized use of application functions in CRM-MKT-ML

**Symptom**
A malicious user can execute functions in CRM-MKT-ML without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
Cross-site request forgery (XSRF), CRM-MKT-ML

**Reason and Prerequisites**
CRM-MKT-ML executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. This can be achieved through a cross-site scripting attack or by presenting a deceptive link to the victim.

**Solution**
1. Refer to [Note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324) and [Note 1551982](https://me.sap.com/notes/1551982) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from these notes are prerequisites for implementing this note.
2. Implement the correction instructions of this note. This will create the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_MKT_ML` in your system.
3. Execute the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_MKT_ML` and provide a corresponding transport request number when prompted. This report will activate the XSRF protection for the BSP applications adapted by this note.
