1594051 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in RA

**SAP Security Note 1594051: Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in Returns Authorization**

**Symptom**

- Non-permanently deface or alter website content.

- Gain unauthorized access with the same privileges as the targeted user, potentially compromising the application's security if an administrator is impersonated.

**Affected Versions**
- Returns Authorization 2.6 JSE 6.0 SP07
- Returns Authorization 2.7 JSE 6.0

**Solution**
A correction has been implemented and is available for the affected versions listed above. Users are advised to apply the relevant support package to mitigate this vulnerability.
