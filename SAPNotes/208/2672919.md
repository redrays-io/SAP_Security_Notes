2672919 - [CVE-2018-2459] Information disclosure in SAP Mobile Platform server Offline OData

## Overview

SAP has released Security Note **2672919**, addressing the [CVE-2018-2459](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-2459) vulnerability. This issue involves information disclosure in the SAP Mobile Platform server's Offline OData component.

## Details

**Symptom:**

Users utilizing an Offline OData application with Offline OData-supplied delta tokens may occasionally receive data values belonging to different users. This occurs when multiple users synchronize simultaneously, resulting in the retrieval of entities with identical key values but differing property values.

**CVSS v3 Base Score:** 4.3 / 10

- **Attack Vector:** Network (N)
- **Attack Complexity:** Low (L)
- **Privileges Required:** Low (L)
- **User Interaction:** None (N)
- **Scope:** Unchanged (U)
- **Confidentiality Impact:** Low (L)
- **Integrity Impact:** None (N)
- **Availability Impact:** None (N)

## Impact

The vulnerability allows unintended information disclosure due to the assumption of globally unique entity IDs in multi-threaded access scenarios, potentially exposing user data to other users.

## Solution

SAP has updated the delta calculation algorithm to no longer assume globally unique entity IDs. The new implementation is thread-safe, preventing the aforementioned data disclosure.

## Affected Components

- **Component:** SAP Mobile Platform on Premise Offline OData Server (MOB-ONP-OOD)
- **Version:** 3.0

## Release Information

- **Released On:** September 11, 2018
