2675696 - [CVE-2018-2478] Remote Code Execution on TREX/BWA

```markdown
**SAP Security Note 2675696 - [CVE-2018-2478] Remote Code Execution on TREX/BWA**

**Symptom**

An attacker can exploit specially crafted inputs to execute commands on the host of a TREX/BWA installation. This vulnerability allows command execution based on the privileges of the `<sid>adm` user. The potential impacts include:

- Unauthorized execution of commands
- Sensitive information disclosure
- Denial of Service

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 6.6/10
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The issue arises from an OS command injection vulnerability where manipulated inputs alter OS commands executed with the authorization of the `<sid>adm` user on the TREX/BWA host.

**Affected Systems:**

- SAP NetWeaver/BW systems connected to TREX/BWA installations with administrator or developer authorizations.

**Solution**

This security note blocks the entry path via transaction input screens for creating and executing altered OS commands. Essential functionalities can still be performed using the TREXAdmin Standalone Tool.

**Support Package Availability**

The fix is included in the following Support Packages:

- **SAP_BASIS 7.00:** Support Package 37
- **SAP_BASIS 7.01:** Support Package 22
- **SAP_BASIS 7.02:** Support Package 22
- **SAP_BASIS 7.30:** Support Package 19
- **SAP_BASIS 7.31:** Support Package 24
- **SAP_BASIS 7.40:** Support Package 21
- **SAP_BASIS 7.50:** Support Package 14
- **SAP_BASIS 7.51:** Support Package 08
- **SAP_BASIS 7.52:** Support Package 04
- **SAP_BASIS 7.53:** Support Package 01

**Recommendations**

1. **Restrict Authorizations:** Review and restrict connections to TREX/BWA systems when assigning developer authorizations.
2. **Follow SAP Guidelines:** Adhere to SAP's recommendations for the authorizations of the `<sid>adm` user, ensuring minimal privileges.
3. **Isolate TREX Installations:** Ensure TREX installations do not share hosts with other applications to mitigate potential risks.
