### **Description**
This SAP Security Note addresses the insufficiency of S_RFC authorization checks in ensuring the secure execution of certain RFC function modules within SAP ERP Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable (FI-CA). It introduces new, switchable authorization checks designed to enhance security for these RFC function modules.

---

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
By default, remote calls of RFC function modules are protected by checks for the authorization object S_RFC. However, these checks alone may not be sufficient for all scenarios. This note is relevant if you are using SAP Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable or its corresponding industry solutions. Ensure that the authorizations for S_RFC are restricted to the minimum required to maintain system security.

---

### **Solution**
The solution involves activating the new switchable authorization checks introduced by this SAP Note. These checks are initially inactive to maintain compatibility with existing processes. To enable them:

1. **Implement the Switchable Authorization Checks:**
   - Use transaction `SACF` to configure the new authorization scenario (`FKK_DOCUMENT_READ`).
   - Follow the correction instructions provided in the note to upload and transfer the scenario definitions.

2. **Activate the Checks:**
   - After updating your system, use transaction `SACF_COMPARE` to activate the switchable authorization checks.
   - Assign the scenario definition to the appropriate development package as outlined in the manual activities section of the note.

For detailed step-by-step instructions, refer to the [Implementation and Activation Guide](https://me.sap.com/notes/2524203).
