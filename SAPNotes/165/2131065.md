**Description**

Performance Management Application can be abused by an attacker, allowing unauthorized modification of displayed application content and potentially obtaining authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3 / 10
- **Attack Vector:** Network (N)
- **Access Complexity:** Medium (M)
- **Authentication Required:** None (N)
- **Impact on Confidentiality:** None (N)

*Note:* This CVSS score is an estimate provided by SAP and does not account for specific system configurations or environments. It's recommended to conduct a thorough risk assessment when determining the applicability and priority of this security note.

**Cause**

The `publishAnalytic` page within the Performance Management Application does not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This can allow attackers to:

- Deface or modify displayed content on the website.
- Steal authentication information, potentially enabling user impersonation and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Compromise application security if an administrator's credentials are stolen.
