**Other Terms:**
- Memory Corruption
- SAP Content Server

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
The issue is caused by a memory corruption that leads to the termination of the process. An attacker can provoke a condition where the process attempts to read outside its memory space, causing a memory protection fault. As a result, the system terminates the process, rendering the application unusable until it is manually restarted.

**Solution:**
Please implement the following manual activities:

```
