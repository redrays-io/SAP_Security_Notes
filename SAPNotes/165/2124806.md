*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment.*

#### Reason and Prerequisites

The issue is caused by a memory corruption that causes the process to terminate. An attacker can provoke a condition in which the process attempts to read outside its memory space, causing a memory protection fault. As a result, the system terminates the process, rendering the application unusable until it is restarted manually.

#### Solution

- **Apply SAP GUI 740 Patch Level 2** or any higher patch.
- **Apply SAP GUI 730 Patch Level 13** or any higher patch.
