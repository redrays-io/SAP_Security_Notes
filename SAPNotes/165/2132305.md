2132305 - Potential modif./disclosure of persisted data in CRM-IM-IPM

**Symptom**

An attacker can exploit CRM-IM-IPM and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands. This results in either the retrieval of additional information or the modification of data persisted by the system.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by an attacker. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to retrieve additional data from the database or to modify the data.
