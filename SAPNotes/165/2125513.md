2125513 - XXE vulnerability in SAP Mobile Platform

**SAP Security Note 2125513 - XXE Vulnerability in SAP Mobile Platform**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 8  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 13.03.2015  
**Component:** Business Mobile > SAP Mobile Platform on Premise > SAP Mobile On Premise Application Services

## Description

**Symptom:**  
Some of the URLs used for Mobiliser administration within SAP Mobile Platform (SMP) can receive XML documents in the request, which are processed by an XML parser. The configuration settings for the XML parser were incorrect, allowing maliciously constructed XML documents to cause undesirable information disclosure and denial of service (DoS) issues.

**CVSS Information:**  
- **Base Score:** 5.5 / 10  
- **Vector:** 
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
  - **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
  - **Authentication (Au):** Single (S)
  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** Partial (P)
  - **Integrity Impact (I):** None (N)
  - **Availability Impact (A):** Partial (P)

**Other Terms:**  
XXE, XML External Entity, information disclosure, denial of service, DoS

**Reason and Prerequisites:**  
The issue is caused by a program error in the 'ValidationComponent' due to the incorrect use of an XML parser. By default, the parser opens external entities referenced within an XML input, which can lead to malicious content being parsed. This malicious content can reference internal resources, such as files, resulting in information disclosure or enabling a denial of service attack by rendering application content temporarily unavailable.

## Affected Software
