### Symptom
An attacker can remotely exploit BC-BMT-WFM-WEB, rendering it, and potentially the resources that are used to serve BC-BMT-WFM-WEB, unavailable.

### Other Terms
DoS, denial of service

### Reason and Prerequisites
An attacker can cause a situation in which the process enters an endless loop that claims the entire available processing time. This causes the entire system to become unresponsive until the process is terminated manually. An attacker can use this flaw to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

### Solution
Implement the correction instructions.

The XML deserialization is protected by an additional function, which uses heuristics to mitigate any attacks. Under certain circumstances, the heuristics might be triggered even though there is no attack (false positive). As a result, you can deactivate this function in transaction SWPA (see attachment “parameter.docx”).
