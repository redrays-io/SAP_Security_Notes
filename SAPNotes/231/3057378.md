3057378 - Missing Authentication check in SAP Web Dispatcher

**Description**

SAP Web Dispatcher does not perform authentication checks for functionalities that require user identity when using authentication based on X.509 client certificates. This vulnerability allows an attacker with network access to execute functions in SAP application systems with any user identity mapped to an X.509 certificate.

**Impact**

An attacker can:
- Read, modify, or delete sensitive information.
- Access administrative or other privileged functionalities.

**Conditions for Being Affected**

A system is affected if:
1. Authentication using X.509 client certificates is configured and active in the application system.
2. Requests to the application system are routed through an SAP Web Dispatcher.
   - Any SAP application system is affected if SAP Web Dispatcher forwards requests to the backend system.
   - SAP HANA with XS (classic or advanced model) includes an embedded SAP Web Dispatcher, making them affected even without a standalone dispatcher.

All versions of SAP Web Dispatcher, SAP HANA, and SAP HANA XS below the patch levels listed in the "Support Package Patches" section are affected.

**Solution**

Apply the necessary patches to ensure that the authenticity of the client is correctly checked. The correction is available in the patch levels specified in the [Support Package Patches](https://me.sap.com/notes/3057378) section of this SAP note.

**How to Implement the Patch:**
- Refer to [SAP Note 908097 - SAP Web Dispatcher: Release, Installation, Patches, Documentation](https://me.sap.com/notes/908097) for updating SAP Web Dispatcher.
- For SAP HANA with XS (classic or advanced model), update the entire system as partial updates are not possible:
  - [SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 04 Database Maintenance Revision 48.06](https://me.sap.com/notes/3044239)
  - [SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 05 Database Revision 56](https://me.sap.com/notes/3043459)
  - [SAP HANA XS, advanced model - SAP Note 3047247](https://me.sap.com/notes/3047247)

**Workaround**

As a temporary measure, you can disable authentication using X.509 client certificates in the application system. However, this will disable access for all users relying on this authentication method. It is strongly recommended to apply the official patches instead.

**CVSS Score**

- **Score:** 8.8
