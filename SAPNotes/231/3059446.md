3059446 - [CVE-2021-33671] Missing Authorization check in SAP NetWeaver Guided Procedures

**Description**

### Symptom
SAP NetWeaver Guided Procedures (Administration Workset) does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in escalation of privileges. Missing authorization could lead to abuse of functionality restricted to specific user groups, allowing unauthorized users to read, modify, or delete restricted data.

### Other Terms
- Access control
- Authorization error
- Authorization profile
- [CVE-2021-33671](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-33671)

### Reason and Prerequisites
Authorization checks are not performed for all access scenarios.

**Solution**
The affected functions have been updated to properly enforce access restrictions. To address this issue, implement the Support Packages and Patches referenced in this [SAP Note 3059446](https://me.sap.com/notes/3059446).

**Workaround**
If Guided Procedures is not utilized, you can disable the GP Administration Workset by adding filters to the configuration template:
1. In NWA -> Java System Properties, select the configuration template.
2. Navigate to the Filters tab and add the filter to disable the `caf~eu~gp~ui~admin` application.

*Note:* This is a temporary fix. It is strongly recommended to apply the corrections outlined in the security note as a permanent solution.
