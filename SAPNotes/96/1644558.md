1644558 - Potential denial of service in Web Intelligence

## Description

**Symptom**

A malicious user can remotely exploit Web Intelligence, rendering it, and potentially the resources that are used to serve Web Intelligence, unavailable.

**Other Terms**

DoS, denial of service, Web Intelligence

**Reason and Prerequisites**

A malicious user can trigger a condition in which the process enters an infinite loop, causing it to consume all of the available processing time. This causes the entire machine to become unresponsive until the process is terminated manually. An malicious user can use this flaw to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack.

**Solution**

Customers using Web Intelligence should install **Fixpack 4.1** or **Service Pack 5**.
