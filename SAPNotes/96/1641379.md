1641379 - Potential disclosure of persisted data in BC-SRV-KPR

## Symptom

A malicious user can exploit BC-SRV-KPR and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, resulting in the retrieval of additional information persisted by the system.

## Other Terms

- SQL injection
- Database
- BC-SRV-KPR

## Reason and Prerequisites

The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement including strings that can be altered by a malicious user. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to retrieve data from the database.

## Solution

Implement the code correction via SNOTE. Alternatively, you can upgrade to the relevant Support Package.
