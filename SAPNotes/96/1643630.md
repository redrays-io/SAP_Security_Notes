**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** December 13, 2011  
**Component:** Customer Relationship Management > Marketing > Direct Mailing

### **Symptom**
Some functions in the CRM Marketing Application can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### **Other Terms**
Stored cross-site scripting, XSS, CSS

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
Some functions in the CRM Marketing Application result in a stored cross-site scripting issue.  
It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the attacker to embed content that is rendered automatically, without the attacker having to target victims individually.  
Stored cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session.  
An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
