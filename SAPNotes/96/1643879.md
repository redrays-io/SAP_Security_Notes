### Symptom
An attacker can discover information relating to passwords which use unencrypted SAP GUI connections. This information could be used to allow the attacker to specialize their attacks against passwords and SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP.

### Other Terms
Information disclosure, SAP GUI

### Reason and Prerequisites
Information such as user passwords can be discovered using unencrypted SAP GUI connections. This information may be used by an attacker to further target SAP NetWeaver.

### Solution
Install a SNC product to secure your communication paths.

There is a default security product provided by SAP to enable encryption between SAP GUI for Windows and SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP. It consists of a client library to be installed at the frontend (SCE Client Encryption) and a backend library to be installed at the Application Server ABAP (Secure Login Library for SCE).
