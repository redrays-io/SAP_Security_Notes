2297227 - Whitelist based Clickjacking Framing Protection in CRM-ISA

**SAP Note 2297227** addresses the vulnerability of CRM-ISA running on JSP technology against Clickjacking attacks. Below is a summary of the key information and steps to mitigate this issue.

### **Symptom**
CRM-ISA is not protected against Clickjacking attacks, which are UI-redressing attacks that trick users into clicking on unintended elements on a webpage.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
Clickjacking exploits standard HTML functionalities without relying on application code weaknesses. To implement protection:
- **Prerequisites:**
  - [SAP Note 2170590](https://me.sap.com/notes/2170590) - Enable and configure ClickJacking solution in SAP NetWeaver Java Server.
  - [SAP Note 2263656](https://me.sap.com/notes/2263656) - Enable the ClickJacking protection in HTMLB Java.

### **Solution**
Standard Clickjacking protections like the X-FRAME-OPTIONS header are unsuitable for common NetWeaver integration scenarios. SAP provides a whitelist-based framework tailored for NetWeaver technologies.
- **Steps:**
  1. Implement the SP Patch Level attached to this note.
  2. Follow the instructions in [SAP Note 2319727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319727) for setting up the Clickjacking protection framework.
  3. For manual configuration, refer to [SAP Note 2327541](https://me.sap.com/notes/2327541).

### **Manual Configuration Steps**
Detailed steps can be found in [SAP Note 2327541](https://me.sap.com/notes/2327541), which guides you through configuring ClickJacking protection in Web Channel/E-Commerce applications.
