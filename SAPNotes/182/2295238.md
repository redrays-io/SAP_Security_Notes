### Title
**Memory Corruption vulnerability in Startup Service**

### Description

#### Symptom
`startsrv` allows an attacker to leverage logical errors in memory management to cause memory corruption. This will make `startsrv` unavailable.

An attacker may also be able to provoke a stack overflow which may lead to information disclosure. Such information can then be used to craft further attacks, possibly with more severe consequences.
