1502918 - Directory Traversal in Archivelink function modules

**Symptom**
Archivelink Function module contains a vulnerability through which a malicious user can potentially read arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly disclosing confidential information.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Archivelink Function module fails to correctly validate the path with which a file that is read from the remote server is referenced. This means that an attacker can potentially point the program to an arbitrary other file on the system, disclosing its contents.
