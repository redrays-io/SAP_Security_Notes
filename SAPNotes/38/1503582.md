1503582 - Missing log off functionality in Runtime Workbench

**SAP Security Note 1503582**

**Overview**
- **Number**: 1503582
- **Type**: SAP Security Note
- **Title**: Missing log off functionality in Runtime Workbench
- **Released On**: April 12, 2011
- **Component**: Basis Components > NetWeaver Process Integration (PI) > Integration Server > Runtime Workbench / Monitoring
- **Version**: 6
- **Priority**: Correction with medium priority
- **Status**: Released for Customer

**Symptom**
The SAP XI Runtime Workbench (RWB) user interface does not provide a log off functionality.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
SAP XI Runtime Workbench is the central UI for monitoring entire XI landscapes. It should provide a way to log off the currently logged-in user from all backend systems in use. Logging off users improves security as unattended terminals do not stay active indefinitely and can be used for unauthorized access by third parties.

**Solution**
The RWB user interface was improved by providing a log off link. The correction is part of the following and newer Support Packages:
- XI 3.0 SP27
- XI 7.0 SP23
- XI 7.01 SP08
- XI 7.02 SP06
- PI 7.10 SP12
- PI 7.11 SP07

**Details:**
Logging off is performed in two steps:
1. Logging off from all backend systems (Adapter Engines) part of the monitored XI landscape.
2. Logging off from the system where RWB is up and running.

After a successful log off, the standard SAP J2EE Engine log off page is displayed.
