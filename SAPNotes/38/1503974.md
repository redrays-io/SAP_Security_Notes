1503974 - Directory Traversal in BC-MOB-LAP

**Description**

**Symptom**
BC-MOB-LAP contains a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to potentially read and write arbitrary files on the client. This can lead to client corruption, unauthorized access to confidential information, and alteration of the NetWeaver Mobile clientâ€™s behavior.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
When the NetWeaver Mobile laptop client is launched as a Windows service, it operates with administrator rights. If a JSP application is launched within a browser from this laptop client, the application inherits these administrator rights. A malicious user can exploit this by traversing the directory structure of the client to read sensitive files or write to restricted directories, potentially corrupting the system or altering the client's behavior.

**Solution**
To address this security vulnerability, the JSP application is now launched from within the client status monitor, which operates with the permissions of the logged-in user rather than administrative rights. 

**Action Required**
Upgrade the NetWeaver Mobile laptop client to at least the patch level specified in the "SP Patch Level" section of [SAP Security Note 1503974](https://me.sap.com/notes/1503974) relevant to your release and support package.
