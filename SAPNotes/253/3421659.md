3421659 - [CVE-2024-22132] Code Injection Vulnerability in SAP IDES Systems

**Symptom**

SAP IDES ECC systems contain code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code of a user's choice. An attacker can control the behavior of the system by executing malicious code, potentially escalating privileges with low impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

**Other Terms**

- Command Injection
- OS Command Injection
- [CVE-2024-22132](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22132)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The program code contains a vulnerability that allows the execution of user-defined code at the OS level, altering the system's behavior.

**Solution**

The vulnerable code has been removed through changes included in the transport. Please import the attached transport request into your IDES ECC systems.

Additionally, it is strongly recommended **not** to install the IDES demo system in the same network as your production environment. Always separate the demo environment from your production environment. Do not set up real master data (e.g., client copies of production systems) in the IDES system.

**Workaround**

Assess the applicability of the following workaround for your SAP landscape before implementation. Note that this workaround is a temporary fix and not a permanent solution. SAP strongly recommends applying the corrections outlined in the security note, either instead of or after implementing the workaround.

- **Deactivate or delete report ZZOAFAIN manually.**
- **Ensure a robust authorization concept for IDES test systems.**

**CVSS**
