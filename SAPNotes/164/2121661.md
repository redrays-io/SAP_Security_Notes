Potential Remote Termination of Running Processes in ABAP & Java Server - SAP Note 2121661

## Description

An attacker can remotely exploit various components of ABAP and Java Server, as well as RFC-bound external components, potentially terminating running processes. This issue is caused by a memory corruption that leads the process to attempt reading outside its memory space, resulting in a memory protection fault. Consequently, the system terminates the process, rendering the application unusable until it is manually restarted.
