### Other Terms

Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, BW-BEX-ET-WJR

### Reason and Prerequisites

Pages within BW-BEX-ET-WJR do not sufficiently encode output parameters while throwing an exception, which can result in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
