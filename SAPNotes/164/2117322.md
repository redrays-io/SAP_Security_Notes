2117322 - SAP BusinessObjects WACS is vulnerable to POODLE attacks

**SAP Security Note 2117322 Overview**

**Symptom**
The Web Application Container Service (WACS) in SAP BusinessObjects systems is vulnerable to POODLE attacks (CVE-2014-3566).

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The Web Application Container Service can fall back to SSL 3.0 when its Protocol option is set to "TLS". This fallback mechanism makes network connections to the service vulnerable to POODLE attacks.

**Solution**
The Web Application Container Service has been updated to ensure that selecting "TLS" as the Protocol in the service configuration properties (e.g., on the Server Properties page in the CMS for the Web Application Container Server) will enable only TLS protocols and disable SSL 3.0. As a result, client applications that do not support TLS will no longer be able to access the service when its protocol is set to "TLS".
