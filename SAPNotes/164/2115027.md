2115027 - Unauthorized use of application functions in Afaria Server

**Symptom**

An attacker can execute functions in the Afaria Server without authentication and authorization.

**CVSS Information**
- **Base Score:** 6.8 / 10
- **Vector:** 
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
  - **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium (M)
  - **Authentication (Au):** None (N)
  - **Impact to Confidentiality (C):** Partial (P)
  - **Impact to Integrity (I):** Partial (P)
  - **Impact to Availability (A):** Partial (P)

**Other Terms**
- Cross-site request forgery (XSRF)
- Afaria Server

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The Afaria Server executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a specific URL and parameters, the function is executed with the user's rights. This can be achieved through a cross-site scripting attack or by presenting a malicious link to the victim.

The vulnerability is limited to a URL in the Afaria Server, as all other pages already contain XSRF protection.

**Solution**

A vulnerability has been discovered in the Afaria Server. SAP has released a security patch to resolve this issue. It is strongly recommended to apply **Afaria 7 SP5 Hotfix 07**.
