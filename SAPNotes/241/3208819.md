3208819 - [CVE-2022-35170] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Portal

**Symptom**

SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Portal does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs over the network, resulting in a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This changes the scope of the attack and leads to a limited impact on the confidentiality and integrity of data.

**Other Terms**

- XSS
- Reflected XSS
- CSS
- [CVE-2022-35170](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35170)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Some request parameter values displayed as part of the Portal markup are encoded incorrectly.

**Solution**

- URL parameters are now properly encoded to prevent a successful XSS attack.
- Implement the [Support Packages and Patches](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/swdc/notes?note=3208819) referenced by this SAP Note.
