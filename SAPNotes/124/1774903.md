**Title:**  
Hard-coded logon information in taskhandler

**Description:**

An attacker can be authenticated to taskhandler functions without having their own legitimate credentials, or they may escalate privileges.

**CVSS Information:**  
- **Base Score:** 6.0  
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P  

*Note:* This CVSS Base Score provided by SAP estimates the risk posed by the issue reported in this SAP Note. It does not account for your specific system configuration or operational environment. Conduct your own risk assessments when deciding on the applicability or priority of this security note. For more information, refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites:**

The vulnerability is caused by a hard-coded username and password combination in the program's source code. An attacker specifying these credentials can log onto the system without legitimate access assigned by the system administrator(s). If a user already has privileges to log on, an escalation of privileges may be possible if the hard-coded account has higher access rights than the original user.

**Solution:**

Import at least the Support Package specified in this SAP Note or implement the relevant correction instructions.
