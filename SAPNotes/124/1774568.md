SAP Security Note 1774568 - Disable (RSC) Service Exposed by the Diagnostics Agent

## SAP Security Note 1774568 - Disable (RSC) Service Exposed by the Diagnostics Agent

### Description

**Symptom**

An attacker can exploit services exposed by the Diagnostics Agent without requiring credentials, provided that the Diagnostics Agent's relevant ports on the managed system host are accessible either directly or indirectly.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 7.5
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

*Please note that the CVSS base score is an estimate and does not account for your specific system configuration or operational environment. It is recommended to conduct a thorough risk assessment when determining the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.*

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The vulnerability exists because the Diagnostics Agent exposes a remote service when used in conjunction with Solution Manager. This remote service should only be available within the context of the Remote Support Component (RSC), which operates independently from Solution Manager. If accessible, this service could potentially be misused by attackers.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that when a Diagnostics Agent is used with Solution Manager (connected to a Solution Manager 7.1 system), the remote service is not accessible. This is automatically achieved by patching the LM-SERVICE Java software component on the Solution Manager system connected to the concerned Diagnostics Agents. The Diagnostics Agents will automatically apply the patch after successful deployment. Additionally, follow the general recommendations provided in [SAP Note 1483508](https://me.sap.com/notes/1483508).
