1776718 - Missing authorization check in password telnet command

---

**SAP Security Note 1776718**

**Title:** Missing authorization check in password telnet command

**Released On:** December 10, 2013

**Description:**
An authenticated user can use functions of the password telnet command to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Affected Components:**
- **Component:** Basis Components > NetWeaver Application Server Java > Security, User Management (BC-JAS-SEC)

**Impact:**
The password telnet command does not include authorization checks to verify an authenticated user's permissions for accessing certain functions. This oversight can lead to undesired system behavior and potential privilege escalation.

**Solution:**
Update your Java AS to a Support Package (SP) or release where the issue is resolved. Refer to the **Support Package Patch** section below for details and available patches.
