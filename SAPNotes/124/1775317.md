1775317 - Directory traversal in IS-PS-CA

## Description

**Symptom**

IS-PS-CA contains a vulnerability through which an attacker can potentially write arbitrary files to the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

**Other Terms**

Directory traversal, IS-PS-CA

**Reason and Prerequisites**

FI-CA fails to correctly validate the path to which a user-submitted file is written. As a result, an attacker can potentially overwrite data in the remote system.

**Solution**

Implement the correction instructions relevant for your release.

SAP Note [1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) contains further information and instructions. The corrections from SAP Note 1497003 are a prerequisite for implementing this SAP Note.

**Logical File Names Used in This Solution**

- FI-CA-COL-SUB

Logical file names used in this solution are created with the correction from SAP Note [1584972](https://me.sap.com/notes/1584972). Therefore, SAP Note 1584972 is a prerequisite for the correction from this SAP Note. The logical file name FI-CA-COL-SUB is used in the correction again.

## Affected Components

- **Component:** IS-PS-CA
- **Versions:** 471, 472, 600, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 616
