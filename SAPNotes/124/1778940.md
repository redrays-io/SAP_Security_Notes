1778940 - HTTP verb tampering issue in SAP_JTECHS

### Symptom

In SAP_JTECHS, there are problems with authorization and authentication checks if certain HTTP methods are used for the URL `http://host:port/usmm`.

An attacker can determine whether certain components are being used that may be subject to a license without having legitimate credentials.

### CVSS Information

- **Base Score**: 4.3
- **Vector**: AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

### Reason and Prerequisites

SAP_JTECHS contains HTTP verb tampering vulnerabilities. This poses a risk of information disclosure or data tampering if an attacker accesses the application using HTTP requests with unexpected methods.

### Solution

Apply the patch provided in SAP Security Note 1778940.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Do not assign** the `SAP_ungranted_role` to any user.
- **Implement SAP Note 1445998** to disable InvokerServlet (not required for SAP NetWeaver 7.20 Support Package 03 and higher).
  
  While HTTP verb tampering and InvokerServlet issues are not prerequisites of each other, implementing both fixes is recommended for enhanced security.
