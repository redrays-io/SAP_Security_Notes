1777053 - Missing authorization check in BC-SEC-USR-ADM

**SAP Security Note 1777053 - Missing authorization check in BC-SEC-USR-ADM**

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use functions of the remote callable function module `SUSR_USER_PASSWORD_STATUS_GET` to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 3.5
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The remote callable function module `SUSR_USER_PASSWORD_STATUS_GET` does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may lead to undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

Apply the correction instructions or implement the relevant Support Package.

   - Navigate to transaction `SE37` in your SAP system.

2. **Modify the Function Module:**

   - Click on the "Change" button. Confirm any "Information" popups if they appear.

3. **Add Authorization Exception:**
   - Go to the "Exceptions" tab.
   - Add a new exception with the following details:
     - **Exception:** `NOT_AUTHORIZED_FOR_OTHER_USER`
     - **Short text:** `No authorization to display other users`

4. **Save the Changes:**
   - After adding the exception, save your changes to the function module.
