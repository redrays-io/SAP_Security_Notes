2983436 - [CVE-2021-21488] Insecure Deserialisation in SAP NetWeaver Knowledge Management

### Symptom

Knowledge Management allows a remote attacker with basic privileges to deserialize user-controlled data without verification, leading to insecure deserialization which triggers the attackerâ€™s code, thereby impacting availability.

Some well-known impacts of the vulnerability are:

- **Total loss of availability** in the service, with the ability to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component.
- **Unauthorized execution of arbitrary commands**.

### Impact

This vulnerability can lead to significant disruptions, including service outages and unauthorized actions within the affected SAP NetWeaver Knowledge Management system.

### CVSS

**CVSS Score:** 6.5

**Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
