1637050 - Unauthorized use of application functions in WS-Browser

**Description**

An attacker can execute functions in WebServices-Browser without authentication and authorization.

**Details**

The WebServices-Browser (BSP 'WebServiceBrowser' / BSP 'SRT_BROWSER') executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. If an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request with certain URLs and parameters, the function executes with the user's permissions. This could be achieved via cross-site scripting (XSS) or by presenting a malicious link to the victim.

**Solution**

1. Refer to [Note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from this note are prerequisites.
2. Implement the correction instructions in this note. Create the report `ZBSP_XSRF_PARAM_SRT_BROWSER` as a local object in your system.
3. Execute the report `ZBSP_XSRF_PARAM_SRT_BROWSER` and provide a relevant transport request number when prompted. This report populates the `BSPTEMPXSRFSTORE` database table with the necessary entries for the adapted BSP applications.
