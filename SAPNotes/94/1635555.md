1635555 - Unauthorized use of application functions in ERMS

**Title:** Unauthorized Use of Application Functions in ERMS

**Description:**
A malicious user can execute functions in CRM-IC-EMS without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms:**
- Cross-site request forgery (XSRF)
- ERMS

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
ERMS executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a specific URL and parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. This can be achieved via cross-site scripting attacks or by presenting a deceptive link to the victim.

**Solution:**
1. **Refer to Prerequisite Notes:**
   - [Note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324)
   - [Note 1551982](https://me.sap.com/notes/1551982)
   
   These notes provide additional information and instructions. Implementing the corrections from these notes is a prerequisite for applying this security note.

2. **Implement Correction Instructions:**
   - Follow the correction instructions provided in this note. This process will create the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_IC_EMS` in your system.

3. **Execute the Report:**
   - Run the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_IC_EMS` and specify a corresponding transport request number when prompted. This will activate XSRF protection for the BSP applications modified by this note.
