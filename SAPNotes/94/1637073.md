## SAP Security Note 1637073 - Potential Modification of Persisted Data in CL_UPG_SHDCLONE

**Description**

### Symptom
An attacker can exploit `CL_UPG_SHDCLONE` and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, resulting in the modification of data persisted by the system.

### Other Terms
SQL-Injection, database, CL_UPG_SHDCLONE, RSUPG_CLONE_TABLES

### Reason and Prerequisites
The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by an attacker. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to modify information in the database.

**Solution**
All SUM versions delivered after January 2012 contain the corrected version of the objects.

**Therefore, this security note is no longer relevant!**
