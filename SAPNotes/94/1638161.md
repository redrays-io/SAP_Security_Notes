1638161 - Unauthorized use of application functions in XMLForms

**SAP Security Note 1638161 - Unauthorized use of application functions in XMLForms**

**Description:**

### Symptom
An attacker can execute functions in XMLForms without authentication and authorization.

### Other Terms
Cross-site request forgery, XSRF, XMLForms

### Reason and Prerequisites
XMLForms executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The attacker may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

### Solution
Deploy the patch containing the XSRF Protection Framework as explained in [SAP Note No. 1450166](https://me.sap.com/notes/1450166), then deploy the latest patch level of the SCAs described in the [Validity](#validity) section of the current note.
