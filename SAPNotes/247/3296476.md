### Symptom
An attacker authenticated as a user with a non-administrative role and a common remote execution authorization can exploit a vulnerable interface to execute application functions beyond their permitted scope. This can lead to reading or modifying any user or application data and potentially making the application unavailable, affecting both ABAP managed systems and the SAP Solution Manager.

### Other Terms
- **ST-PI**
- [CVE-2023-27893](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27893)

### Reason and Prerequisites
An enhancement concept for SAP Solution Manager, Custom Code Lifecycle Management, allowed the switching of standard function modules to collect data from the monitored system by custom function modules. This vulnerability affects systems with Addon ST-PI in the following versions:
- ST-PI 2008_1_700 SP11 - SP31
- ST-PI 2008_1_710 SP11 - SP31
- ST-PI 740 SP01 - SP21

### Solution
Implement the correction attached to this note. The correction instructions address this vulnerability by:
1. Calling the standard function module only without the option to switch to a custom function.
2. Removing the code completely from the affected function module if the function is obsolete.
