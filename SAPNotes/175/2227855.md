**Title**
2227855 - SMP unauthenticated access to SysAdminWebTool servlets

**Description**

### Symptom

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

### Other Terms
Denial of service. Information disclosure.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Some web services were added to the SCC server in ancillary support of some native functions of the UI like log uploads/downloads and application deployment. Normal usage would require a user to authenticate as a user in the Administrator role before they would navigate to use these services, but an attacker with network access to this server could bypass this normal usage.

### Solution
This is fixed in SAP Mobile Platform SP09 and SAP Mobile Server 2.3.7.
