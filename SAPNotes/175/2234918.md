2234918 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in PMI

**SAP Note Number**: 2234918  
**Type**: SAP Security Note  
**Released On**: 12.01.2016  
**Category**: Program error  
**Priority**: Correction with high priority  
**Status**: Released for Customer  
**CVSS Base Score**: 4.3 / 10

### Description

**Symptom**  
PMI can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**  
CVSS Base Score: 4.3 / 10  
- **Attack Vector (AV)**: Network (N)  
- **Access Complexity (AC)**: Medium (M)  
- **Authentication (Au)**: None (N)  
- **Confidentiality Impact (C)**: None (N)  
- **Integrity Impact (I)**: Partial (P)  
- **Availability Impact (A)**: None (N)  

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
Pages within PMI do not sufficiently encode INPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a web site. It can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate the user and access information with the same rights as the target user.

### Solution

Please upgrade to the latest Support Package or deploy a patch with the appropriate patch level. The minimum patch level information is provided in the "SP Patch Level" section of this note. As a temporary workaround, you can safely undeploy `tc~pmi~test`.
