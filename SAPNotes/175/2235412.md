### **Symptom**
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in SAP Download Manager.

### **Other Terms**

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
Improper certificate verification and insecure network communication are present in SAP Download Manager.

1. **Save your SAP Download Manager connection information.**
2. **Close SAP Download Manager.**
3. **Locate and delete the existing `dlgmanager.config` file stored in your default home directory:**

    | Operating System                  | Path                                   | Environment Variable |
    |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
    | Microsoft Windows NT              | `<root>\WINNT\Profiles\<username>`     | `%UserProfile%`       |
    | Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, 2003  | `<root>\Documents and Settings\<username>` | `%UserProfile%`       |
    | Microsoft Windows Vista, 7, 8     | `<root>\Users\<username>`              | `%UserProfile%`       |

    | Linux/BSD (FHS)                    | `/home/<username>`                     | `$HOME`               |
    | Mac OS X                           | `/Users/<username>`                    | `$HOME`               |
