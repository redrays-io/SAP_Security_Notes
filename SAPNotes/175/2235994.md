**SAP Security Note 2235994: Untrusted XML Input Parsing Possible in Configuration Wizard**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 4  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.03.2016  
**Component:** Basis Components > Installation Tools (SAP Note 1669327) > Central technical configuration

### Description

A vulnerability exists in the Configuration Wizard due to incorrect usage of an XML parser. An attacker can modify an XML-based request to include malicious XML content that is parsed locally. This can lead to:

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Rendering the parsing system temporarily unavailable.
- **Information Disclosure:** Local data may be disclosed in the response to the malicious request.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Access to network-located resources accessible from the parsing system.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 6.4 / 10  
- **CVSS v3 Base Vector:**  
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Adjacent Network (A)  
  - **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H)  
  - **Privileges Required (PR):** High (H)  
  - **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  
  - **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  
  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** High (H)  
  - **Integrity Impact (I):** High (H)  
  - **Availability Impact (A):** High (H)

_SAP provides this CVSS v3 base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment._

### Reason and Prerequisites

The issue is caused by a program error in the Configuration Wizard due to incorrect use of an XML parser. By default, the parser opens external entities referenced within an XML input, allowing malicious content to be parsed. This malicious content can reference internal resources, such as files, which can be disclosed in the response or used to perform a DoS attack on the parsing system.

### Solution

**Update AS Java to a Support Package (SP) or release where the issue is fixed.** Refer to the Support Package Patch Level section below for details and available patches.
