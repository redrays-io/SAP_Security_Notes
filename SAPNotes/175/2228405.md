SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. It does not account for your specific system configuration or operational environment.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The EPCF Loader Tester results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This can be exploited to permanently modify displayed content on a website, allowing attackers to embed content that is rendered automatically without targeting victims individually. Additionally, stored XSS can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as session data, which can be leveraged to impersonate the user and access information with their privileges. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Apply the latest patches attached to this note to mitigate the vulnerability.
