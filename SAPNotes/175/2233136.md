_SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment.

**Other Terms**

DoS, SAP HANA, IMPORT

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Specially crafted input might cause the process to terminate. An authenticated attacker with the IMPORT system privilege can provoke a condition where the process attempts to read invalid data, resulting in the termination of the indexserver process. This renders the application unusable until it is restarted automatically.

### Solution

The issue is fixed with revision **102.02 (for SPS10)**. **SPS11** is not affected.  
**Action:** Update to these or later revisions.

**Workaround:**

- Limit the IMPORT authorization to trusted applications/users.
