1329703 - ECL Viewer 6.0 Patch 2 (security update)

**Symptom**

Security vulnerability in `MonikerUtil_dll.dll` which can be exploitable through `WebViewer3D.dll`. The previous security patch for ECL Viewer (see [SAP note 1153794](https://me.sap.com/notes/1153794)) did not solve the vulnerability for all potential attack vectors.

**Other Terms**

CVE-2007-4475, US-CERT, VU#985449, CERT/CC, Secunia, SA34559  
ECL Viewer 6.0, Security, MonikerUtil_dll.dll, WebViewer3D.dll, kill bit

**Reason and Prerequisites**

You have set the kill-bits as described in [SAP note 1153794](https://me.sap.com/notes/1153794), but it has been discovered that the kill-bit is not sufficient to protect against all potential attacks. Only by patching the ECL Viewer with Patch 2 will the system be protected from any other attack vectors.

We are currently not aware of a possibility to exploit any of the other attack vectors, but due to the public knowledge about this issue, it may only be a question of time until an exploitable attack vector is discovered.  
The vulnerability may be exploited for anonymous remote code execution.  
If you are using any older version of ECL Viewer, it is suggested that you upgrade to ECL Viewer 6.0 with the latest patch (Patch #2).
