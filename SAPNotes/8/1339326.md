SAP Security Note 1339326 - F&R: Remove hardcoded user name branches in code (security)

**Description**

**Symptom:**  
No symptoms. SAP internal security audit.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**  
Production code makes comparisons between `sy-uname` and hardcoded values. Security implications are negligible; however, the application may perform unexpectedly if the user name matches a hardcoded value. These comparisons have now been removed.

Implement the correction instructions or install the associated Support Package.
