1335926 - Some Fields are susceptible to Cross-site scripting

**Description**
This SAP Security Note addresses a Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in several fields within the Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) module. Specifically, when entering dynamic attribute descriptions or other field descriptions with malicious scripts, the system fails to mask these inputs correctly, allowing the execution of unauthorized scripts.

**Affected Component**
- **Component:** SRM-EBP-TEC-ITS
- **Released On:** 12.10.2009
- **Status:** Released for Customer
- **Priority:** Correction with medium priority

**Symptoms**
When a Bid invitation is created with a dynamic attribute description containing a script (e.g., `<a href="javascript:alert();">Click me!</a>`), the system displays a dialog box with the injected text instead of executing the script. This issue also affects other descriptions such as Partner details, Bidder output data details in Bid invitations, and Incoterm Descriptions in Quotations.

**Reason**
The vulnerability is due to a program error where certain fields are not properly masked, allowing malicious scripts to be executed.
