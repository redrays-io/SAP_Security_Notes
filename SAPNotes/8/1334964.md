**Description**

### Symptom
You want to ensure that no intruder calls external commands in your system.

### Other Terms
sapxpg, SNC, Secure Network Communication

### Reason and Prerequisites
An authentication of the caller is missing in the previous security measure that is described in Note 866732.

### Solution
You can now authenticate the caller of an external command using SNC (Secure Network Communication). *(Technical information: Since an external command is always called via the RFC server program sapxpg, the caller is authenticated by sapxpg.)*

You must activate the new function because it is not the default setting. To use the new function, you must make settings on the calling side (SAP system) and on the target side (sapxpg). The attached document describes this topic in detail.
