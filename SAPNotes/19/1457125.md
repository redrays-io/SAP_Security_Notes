1457125 - Java Applet not working in cFolders

**Symptom**
Java Applet not working in cFolders. Error describes "400 session not found".

**Other Terms**
Applet, HTTP Error 400, BOM redlining, Document upload, Document download, HTTP-only

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The security-relevant system profile parameter `icf/set_HTTPonly_flag_on_cookies` was activated for the ABAP application server (`icf/set_HTTPonly_flag_on_cookies = 0`). The HttpOnly flag will be set for system cookies as a result of this parameter.

The file upload and download functionality is not working in a secured environment. Note [1420203](https://me.sap.com/notes/1420203) must be implemented!
