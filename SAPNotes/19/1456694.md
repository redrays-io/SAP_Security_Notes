### Description
You want to ensure that the SAP Software you are using via a Web Browser is secure.

**Other Terms:**  
- Security issues  
- Browser patches  
- Product Availability Matrix (PAM)

**Reason and Prerequisites:**  
You use a Web Browser which is supported by SAP (see supported Web Browser Platforms at [SAP PAM](https://service.sap.com/pam)), and the Web Browser might have security issues which the browser vendor has already fixed via a patch (see the Web Browser vendor websites for details).

**Solution:**  
The security of SAP Software used via Web Browser is to some degree dependent on the security of the used browser. Therefore SAP recommends in general to apply all security-relevant patches recommended by the Web Browser vendor to all your browser installations in a very timely manner. Also, SAP recommends that you use only releases of a Web Browser which are still supported by the Web Browser vendor in the sense that the Web Browser vendor delivers security patches for them if required.
