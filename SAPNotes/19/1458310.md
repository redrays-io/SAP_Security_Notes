### SAP Security Note 1458310 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in InfoView

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 12.10.2010  
**Component:** Business intelligence solutions > Reporting, analysis, and dashboards > Crystal Reports designer or Business View Manager

#### Description

The InfoView application could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

#### Reason and Prerequisites

A page within InfoView does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. An attacker can use this to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content or steal authentication information to impersonate users, potentially compromising application security.

#### Solution

Customers should install **XIR3 FP2.9** or **FP3.1**.
