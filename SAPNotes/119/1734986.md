**Other Terms**

**Reason and Prerequisites**

SAP start service executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The attacker may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

**Solution**

Apply the kernel patch specified in this SAP Note to solve this problem. Use this kernel or a more recent kernel.
