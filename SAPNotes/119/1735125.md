### Description

#### Symptom
Under certain conditions, the usage of Solution Builder can lead to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.

#### Other Terms
- Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Solution Builder
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF, XSRF)
- SAP Business All-in-One (BAiO)
- Rapid Deployment Solutions (RDS)

#### Reason and Prerequisites
A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a website. Additionally, XSS can be exploited to steal a user's authentication information, such as session data. An attacker with access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same permissions as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the entire application may be compromised.

#### Solution
According to the Quick Guide for implementing SAP Best Practices Packages/RDS Packages, it is strongly recommended to use the latest available Add-On of Solution Builder (BP-SOLBLD) for security-related purposes. If the newest Add-On of Solution Builder cannot be used due to technical restrictions or other reasons, it is highly recommended (as described in the Quick Guide) to apply the latest available version of the corresponding hotfix note.
