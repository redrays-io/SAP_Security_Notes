1737708 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CRM-ISA-SH

```markdown
**SAP Note:** 1737708  
**Title:** Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CRM-ISA-SH  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Released On:** September 11, 2012  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Category:** Program error  
**Language:** English  
**Recency:** New  

### Symptom
CRM-ISA-SHA can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within CRM-ISA-SHA do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Additionally, it can be used to steal another user's authentication information, potentially allowing attackers to impersonate users and access information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
