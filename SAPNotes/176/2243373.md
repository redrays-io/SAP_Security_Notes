2243373 - Potential denial of service in BC-WD-JAV

### Symptom

An attacker can remotely exploit the Webdynpro Java application, rendering it and potentially the resources used to serve Webdynpro Java unavailable.

### Other Terms

DoS, denial of service, WebDynpro Java, WebDynpro Runtime

### Reason and Prerequisites

An attacker can trigger a condition in which the process enters an endless loop, causing it to consume all available processing time. This causes the entire machine to become unresponsive until the process is terminated manually. An attacker can use this flaw to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

The problem is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can launch a specifically crafted request that causes the process to consume excessive resources. As a result, no other processes can allocate new resources, rendering the system unavailable. This condition can be intentionally provoked by an attacker to cause a denial of service.
