### Reason and Prerequisites
The issue is caused by a memory corruption that leads to the termination of the PCo process. An attacker can provoke a condition causing the process to read outside its memory space, resulting in a memory protection fault. Consequently, the system terminates the process, rendering the application unusable until it is manually restarted.

### Solution
Apply the latest patches for PCo versions 2.2, 2.3, 15.0, and 15.1 to correct this error.

- **Download the Installation Program:** Obtain the latest patch from the [SAP Service Marketplace](https://me.sap.com/) and follow the instructions in the [installation guide](http://help.sap.com/pco).

**Important Installation Notes:**
1. **Backup Configuration:** Before upgrading, export all agent instances via **Plant Connectivity -> Export/Import Configuration** in the Management Console.
2. **Stop Agent Instances:** Ensure all agent instances are stopped and the Management Console is closed before starting the installation.
3. **System Restart:** If prompted for a system restart during installation, perform the restart before continuing with the PCo installation.
