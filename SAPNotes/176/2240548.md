2240548 - Unauthorized use of application functions in SLD

**SAP Security Note 2240548 - Unauthorized use of application functions in SLD**

**Description**

### Symptom
An attacker can execute functions in SLD without authentication and authorization.

### Other Terms
Cross-site request forgery, XSRF, SLD

### Reason and Prerequisites
SLD executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The attacker may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

### Solution
Update your AS Java to an SP or release where the issue is fixed. See the SP Patch Level section for details and available patches.
