SAP Note 2240274 - SAP MII uses Base64 and DES for securing passwords

**SAP Note/KBA:** 2240274  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 10.11.2015  
**Component:** SAP Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence (MFG-MII)  

### Symptom
SAP MII allows Base64 and DES algorithm selection from encryption configuration and export configuration screens.

### CVSS Information
- **Base Score:** 2.1 / 10
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

### Reason and Prerequisites
This was done as per product design.

### Solution
Base64 and DES are inherently insecure algorithms. After applying the patch mentioned in the [Support Packages and Patches](https://me.sap.com/notes/2240274/SUPPORT_PACKAGES_AND_PATCHES), the ability to change the algorithm to Base64 or DES will not be allowed. If MII is being migrated from a lower version, please manually change the encryption algorithm to TripleDES from the **Security Services â†’ Encryption Configuration** screen.

Additionally, the roles to perform changes to the algorithm are governed by MII Administrators. Administrators should assign roles to change encryption configuration to authorized users only.

In further patches, the option of selecting Base64 and DES will be removed altogether from the screen.
