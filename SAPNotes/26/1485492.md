1485492 - Hard-coded user name in article maintenance

## Symptom

A hard-coded user name can change the system behavior if a user is authenticated to the system using this name.

## Other Terms

MM41, MM42, MM43

## Reason and Prerequisites

The program source code contains a hard-coded user name. If a user successfully logs on to the system with this name, an undesired additional function that was implemented for test purposes only may be executed. Calling the additional function has no direct effects, as only data that is not then processed further is returned to the calling program. In extreme cases, the additional function only slightly increases the runtime of the application.

## Solution

Implement the attached corrections.
