1486380 - Potential information disclosure relating to users and pwds

### Potential Information Disclosure Relating to Users and Passwords

**Symptom**  
A malicious user can discover information related to usernames and passwords used in NW PI. This information could be exploited to tailor attacks against NW PI, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
The vulnerability arises because information such as usernames and passwords can be discovered if certain security configurations are not properly set within the Exchange Profile.

**Solution**  
To mitigate this security vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. **Update Exchange Profile Parameter:**
   - **Parameter:** `com.sap.aii.ib.remote.exprof.enabled`
   - **Action:** Set this parameter to `FALSE` or uncheck the corresponding checkbox if it's of Boolean type. This change helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive profile information.
   - **Location:** This parameter is located under the parent `IntegrationBuilder` in the Exchange Profile.

2. **Configure Backend Systems:**
   - Ensure that all backend systems connected to PI use the RFC-Destination `SAP_PROXY_ESR` in SPROXY.
   - For SAP Basis release 640, refer to [SAP Note 1493325](https://me.sap.com/notes/1493325) for additional guidance.

3. **Manual Creation of Destinations:**
   - **Destination:** `CentralMonitoringServer-XIAlerts`
   - **Action:** Manually create this destination as it is no longer created automatically with the update. This destination is essential for sending alerts from Backend Integration Engines.

4. **Upgrade Considerations:**
   - For upgrades to 730 SP1, follow the same steps as for new installations of 730 SP1.
   - If ensuring that all backend systems use `SAP_PROXY_ESR` during the upgrade is not feasible, you may temporarily set `com.sap.aii.ib.remote.exprof.enabled` to `TRUE` to maintain compatibility.
