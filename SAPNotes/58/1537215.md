SAP Security Note 1537215 - Hard-coded credentials in BC-MOB-DOE-BEI

**Symptom**
BC-MOB-DOE-BEI contains code that changes the program's behavior when a user is successfully authenticated with a certain username.

A malicious user can be authenticated to BC-MOB-DOE-BEI without having their own legitimate credentials, or they may escalate privileges.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The program code contains a hard-coded username-password combination in the program's source code. A malicious user who specifies these credentials can log on to the system without having been assigned legitimate access by the system administrator(s). If a user already has privileges with which they can log on, an escalation of privileges may be possible if the hard-coded account has higher access rights than the original user.

**Pre-requisites:**
- You are on SP08 - SP11 of WebAS 7.10
- **OR**
- You are on a Support Package lower than SP07 of WebAS 7.11

**Solution**
Hardcoded username is removed from the Function modules.
