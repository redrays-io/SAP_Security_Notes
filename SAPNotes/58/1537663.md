1537663 - Biller Direct, Security - Invoker Servlet

**Overview**

This SAP Security Note addresses a vulnerability in the Biller Direct component related to the Invoker Servlet feature. The issue allows unauthorized invocation of servlets, potentially leading to security breaches.

**Symptom**

The Invoker Servlet mapping `"/servlet/*"` permits HTTP clients to invoke arbitrary servlets by specifying their name or class, even if they are not defined in the application's `web.xml` file. This can enable attackers to access and execute unintended servlets without proper authentication.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to disable the Invoker Servlet by relying solely on locally defined servlets in the `web.xml` file. Follow these steps:

1. **Scan `webbase-config.xml`:**
   - Search for the keyword `"/servlet"` to identify all servlet paths, such as `<path>/servlet/BillDisplay</path>`.
   
2. **Update `web.xml`:**
   - Open the `web.xml` file of the application.
   - For each servlet path identified in the previous step, append the following servlet mapping:
     ```xml
     <servlet-mapping>
         <servlet-name>BillDisplay</servlet-name>
         <url-pattern>/servlet/BillDisplay/*</url-pattern>
     </servlet-mapping>
     ```
   - Repeat this for each servlet identified to ensure they are properly mapped and secured.

**Affected Components**

- **Financials > Financial Supply Chain Management > Biller Direct > Frontend (FSCM_BD-FE)**
