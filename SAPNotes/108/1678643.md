1678643 - Unauthorized Modification in BSP Application in FIN-SEM-CPM

**SAP Note 1678643: Unauthorized Modification in BSP Application in FIN-SEM-CPM**

**Symptom**
FIN-SEM-CPM can be exploited by a malicious user, allowing unauthorized modification of displayed application content and potential theft of authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- FIN-SEM-CPM

**Reason and Prerequisites**
BSP Page(s) (SC_WIZARD) within FIN-SEM-CPM do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This can enable attackers to steal another user's authentication information, potentially allowing them to impersonate the user and access sensitive information. If an administrator is impersonated, the entire application's security could be compromised.

**Solution**
Apply this SAP Note or import the changes via the relevant support package. The correction includes switching the HTMLB design for the following application:

- **SC_WIZARD**

Switching to DESIGN2008 is necessary for compatibility reasons and will not impact the functionality of your application.
