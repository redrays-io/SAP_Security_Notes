**Title:** Unauthorized modif. of stored content in RSBCT_RFASH_ALI

### Symptom
The BSP application `RSBCT_RFASH_ALI` can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Stored cross-site scripting, XSS, `RSBCT_RFASH_ALI`

### Reason and Prerequisites
The support of an obsolete BSP design may result in a stored cross-site scripting issue.  
It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the attacker to embed content that is rendered automatically, without the attacker having to target victims individually.  
Stored cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session.  
An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution
Implement the relevant correction instructions or import the relevant Support Package.
