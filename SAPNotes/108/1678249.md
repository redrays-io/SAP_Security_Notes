1678249 - Unauthorized modification in BSP application in CRM-RPL-SRV

## Description

### Symptom
Application component CRM-RPL-SRV can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Cross-site scripting, XSS, CRM-RPL-SRV

### Reason and Prerequisites
BSP Page `ResGAnTTProxy.htm` of BSP application `WDFGANTT` within the application component CRM-RPL-SRV does not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.

If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution
Please apply this note or import the changes via the relevant support package.
