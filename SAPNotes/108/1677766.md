1677766 - Unauthorized modification in ITS-Service in KANBAN

---

**Symptom**

PKW1 can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

Cross-site scripting, XSS, PKW1

**Reason and Prerequisites**

ITS Service PKW1 in application component PP-KAB does not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting issue.

Cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.

If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
