### Symptom
The BSP for e-mails in ICM can be abused by a malicious user allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Cross Site Scripting, XSS, BSP

### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within the BSP do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a cross site scripting issue.  
Cross site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use this to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.
