SAP Security Note 2091973 - Missing authorization check in FS-CD

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functions of FS-CD to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
FS-CD does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access certain functions. This may lead to undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

- **Implement Correction Instructions**: Follow the correction instructions provided in [Correction Instructions](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0002091973/21) to add the necessary authorization checks manually.
