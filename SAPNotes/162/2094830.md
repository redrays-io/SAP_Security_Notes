### **Symptom**

An attacker can discover information relating to mobile onboarding, which is stored in the DataVault. This information could be used to allow the attacker to specialize their attacks against the corporate infrastructure.

### **CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 4.7 / 10
- **Access Vector (AV):** Local (L)
- **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium (M)
- **Authentication (Au):** None (N)
- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** Complete (C)
- **Integrity Impact (I):** None (N)
- **Availability Impact (A):** None (N)

_SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment._

### **Reason and Prerequisites**

Information such as the username and backend password can be discovered using the DataVault. This information may be used by an attacker to further target backend systems.

The DataVault is stored in secure locations on the client device—keychain on iOS, private tables on Android—which are normally sandboxed on the device. An attacker would need to jailbreak/root the device to obtain access to the encrypted data or would need physical control of the device and tools to extract a memory dump. This solution provides a better form of encryption, so the attacker also needs to know the correct application passcode to extract any data.

### **Solution**

Build your application with DataVault version **2.2.6**, **2.3.5**, or newer.

This issue is in the client SDK only. Applications must be rebuilt with the newest client SDK libraries to correct the vulnerability.
