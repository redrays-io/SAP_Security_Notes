2090013 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in NetWeaver logon application

**Symptom**

The NetWeaver logon application can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 4.3 / 10
- **Vector:** 
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
  - **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium (M)
  - **Authentication (Au):** None (N)
  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** None (N)
  - **Integrity Impact (I):** Partial (P)
  - **Availability Impact (A):** None (N)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The logon pages within the NetWeaver logon application do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This can be exploited to deface or modify displayed content and steal user authentication information, potentially allowing attackers to impersonate users with the same rights.
