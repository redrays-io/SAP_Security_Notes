2090851 - Untrusted XML input parsing possible in SLD

## Symptom

An attacker can modify an XML-based request to include malicious XML content that is then parsed locally. This could allow a malicious user to perform a denial of service (DoS) on the parsing system, disclose local data returned in the response to the malicious request, or access further network-located resources accessible from the parsing system.

## CVSS Information

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.9 / 10
- **Attack Vector:** Network (N)
- **Attack Complexity:** Medium (M)
- **Privileges Required:** Single (S)
- **Confidentiality Impact:** None (N)
- **Integrity Impact:** Partial (P)
- **Availability Impact:** Partial (P)

_SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://support.sap.com/securitynotes](https://support.sap.com/securitynotes)._

## Reason and Prerequisites

The problem is caused by a program error in SLD due to the incorrect use of an XML parser. By default, the parser opens external entities referenced within an XML input, which can lead to malicious content being parsed. This malicious content can reference internal resources, such as files, which can be disclosed in the response to the request or used to perform a denial of service attack on the parsing system, rendering application content temporarily unavailable.

## Solution

Update your AS Java to a Support Package (SP) or release where the issue is fixed. Refer to the [Support Package Patches](https://me.sap.com/notes/0002090851/E/diff) section for details and available patches.
