2098608 - XML External Entity vulnerability in SAP XML Parser

---

**Symptom**

A malicious user can modify an XML-based request to include XML content that is then parsed locally. This could allow a malicious user to perform a denial of service (DoS) on the parsing system, disclose local data that is then returned in the response to the malicious request, or access further network-located resources that are accessible from the parsing system.

**CVSS Information**

  | Metric                     | Value               |
  |----------------------------|---------------------|
  | Attack Vector (AV)         | Network (N)         |
  | Attack Complexity (AC)     | Low (L)             |
  | Authentication (Au)        | Single (S)          |
  | Confidentiality Impact (C) | Partial (P)         |

**Other Terms**

XXE, XML eXternal Entity, information disclosure, denial of service, DoS, EP-PIN-IVS-UPL

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The problem is caused by a program error in `'ValidationComponent'` due to the incorrect use of an XML parser. By default, the parser opens external entities referenced within an XML input, which can lead to malicious content being parsed. This malicious content can reference internal resources, such as files, which can then be disclosed in the response or used to perform a DoS attack on the parsing system, rendering application content temporarily unavailable.
