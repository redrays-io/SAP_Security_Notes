**Vector**: AV:N/AC:H/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N  

SAP is providing this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into consideration your own system configuration or operational environment.

### Other Terms
- Example applications, NW Dev Studio, J2EE

### Reason and Prerequisites
The example applications originally shipped with the Engine provided demonstrations for basic J2EE functionality. These samples have been deleted from the Engine delivery as per [SAP Note 1421523](https://me.sap.com/notes/1421523) due to security issues. However, some samples remain in the NetWeaver Developer Studio under the `<IDE>/eclipse/examples` directory.

**Important**: The examples shipped with the IDE are not reusable software components for direct inclusion in other applications or deployment on productive systems. They are meant to demonstrate certain APIs and functionalities in a simplistic manner. Security, accessibility, internationalization (i18n), and other aspects may not be fully covered. Ensure you address these aspects when developing custom code. SAP has removed the binaries to prevent direct deployment of binaries with known issues.

### Solution
Undeploy the following example applications from the Engine using SDM:
- **CalculatorEar**
- **JavaMailEar**
- **MDB**
