SAP Security Note 1553387 - Violation of PIL 2.0 Security Standard Requirement

**Description**

**Symptom**
SEC-133: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS, CSS)

AI_SBUSDOC can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
A BSP-page within AI_SBUSDOC does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. It can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**
Install SP10.
