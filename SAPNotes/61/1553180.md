1553180 - Missing authorization check

**Description**

An authenticated user can use certain functions of SAP systems without having the required authorization for this. This enables the user to display any text for a different user in a dialog box.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.0
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:S/C:N/I:N/A:P

*Note:* This CVSS Base Score provided by SAP is used to estimate the risk posed by the issue reported in this SAP Note. It does not account for your own system configuration or operational environment. Conduct your own risk assessments when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

SAP systems do not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of their functions. Without these checks, an authenticated user can call these functions without the desired system behavior.

**Solution**

1. Implement the attached correction instructions. You can download them [here](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001553180/41).

2. Set the undocumented profile parameter `rdisp/th_popup/strict_check = 1`.

3. Execute the authorization check for the authorization object `S_ADMI_FCD` from the class `BC_A`.

4. In transaction SE12, manually create a new entry for the domain `XUFUNCTION`:
   - Choose "Change" and switch to the "Value Range" tab.
   - Go to "Single Vals".
   - Enter the following new fixed value:
     - **Fix.Val.:** POPU
     - **Short Description:** TH_POPUP
   - Activate the domain `XUFUNCTION`.

After these steps, the problem is resolved as of the listed Support Packages.

**Support Package**
