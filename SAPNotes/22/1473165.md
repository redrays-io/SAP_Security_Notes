### **Title**
**1473165 - Obsolete programs in PSM-FG - Directory Traversal**

### **Description**
#### **Symptom**
Potential Directory Traversal in the following components:
- **PSM-FG**

1. Some programs within component PSM-FG contain vulnerabilities through which a malicious user can potentially read arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly disclosing confidential information.
2. Some of the programs within component PSM-FG contain a vulnerability through which a malicious user can potentially write arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

#### **Reason and Prerequisites**
Some programs within component PSM-FG fail to correctly validate the path a user-submitted file is read from or written to. Through this, an attacker can potentially point the program to an arbitrary other file on the system, disclosing its contents or overwriting data on the remote system.

#### **Solution**
The affected programs are obsolete, so instead of doing extensive changes in the programs, the source code is commented out to prevent the programs from accessing confidential data.
