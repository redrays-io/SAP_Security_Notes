### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functionality of Business Partner to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an escalation of privileges.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Business Partner lacks permission checks for an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functionality. This may result in undesired system behavior.

### Solution
Implement this note or the related support package.

The dynamic transaction calls are now validated using appropriate authority checks, ensuring that they can only be executed by users authorized to perform these transactions.
