---

**Description**

### Symptom
A malicious user can exploit SAP Crystal Server 2008 and take complete control of the product, including viewing, changing, or deleting data.

### Other Terms
Buffer overrun, Remote Command Execution

### Reason and Prerequisites
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in SAP Crystal Server 2008. This enables a malicious user to inject code into the working memory that is subsequently executed by the application. It can also be used to cause a general fault in the product, thereby producing a termination of the product.

### Solution

**Workaround:**
- Set up SSL over Corba for the server tier.
- Place the CMS service behind a firewall.
- Disable Corba traffic from the external network.

**Patch:**
- **XIR2 customers** should install FixPack 6.3.
- **XIR3 customers** should install FixPack 2.8 or 3.1.
