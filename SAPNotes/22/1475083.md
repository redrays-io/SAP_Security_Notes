1475083 - Possible disclosure of saved data in cluster builder

## Symptom
This note is relevant only if you use the application component **FS-CD** (software component **INSURANCE**). If you do not use this component, you are not affected by the problem and you do not have to implement this note.  
An attacker can output any data by making specific entries in a function module.

## Other Terms
- SQL, Structured Query Language
- SQL injection
- Database
- Integration of FS-CD or CRM

## Reason and Prerequisites
This vulnerability is due to a SQL injection deficiency. In the source code, an SQL statement is composed out of strings. An attacker can gain control over the content of a substring, allowing manipulation of the complete statement and execution of all SQL commands with the permissions of the database user that is logged on.

## Solution
The relevant parts of the function module interface are not used. This note modifies the source code by turning it into a comment.

## Affected Software Components
- **INSURANCE** from versions 471 to 605
