## Overview
**SAP Note Number:** 1472293  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 7  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error

**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** February 14, 2012  
**Component:** Supplier Relationship Management > SRM > Organization/Business Partner Administration > External Business Partner

## Description

### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functionality of Business Partner to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an escalation of privileges.

### Other Terms
SRM, supplier relationship management, EBP, security, business partner, BBP_VENDOR_GET_DATA_JOB, BBP_VENDOR_UPDATE_DATA_JOB.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Business Partner lacks permission checks for an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functionality. This may result in undesired system behavior.

## Solution
Implement this note or the related support package.

The dynamic transaction calls are now validated using appropriate authority checks so that they can now be called only by users authorized to execute the transactions.
