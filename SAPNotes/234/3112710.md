3112710 - [CVE-2021-42067] Information Disclosure vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform

**Description**

An attacker authenticated as a regular user can exploit the S/4HANA dashboard to reveal systems and services that are typically restricted. While this vulnerability allows for information disclosure, it does not permit information alteration or denial of service.

**CVE Information**
- **CVE:** [CVE-2021-42067](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42067)

**Solution**

The authorization check has been enhanced with the authorization object `S_RZL_ADM`:
- **Display Activity 03:** Allows users to start the Web Dynpro Application.
- **Change Activity 01:** Permits users to make changes.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Run Transaction SE80 and display the Web Dynpro Components/Interfaces `GRMG_JWS`.
2. Double-click on `COMPONENTCONTROLLER`.
3. From the system menu, navigate to **Goto → Text Symbols**.
4. Switch to edit mode, confirm editing in the original language, and add the following text:

   ```
   Sym   Text                    Lngth   Max.
   024   Berichtigungsobjekt S_RZL_ADM überprüfen.   41      92
   ```

**Workaround**

Before applying the fix, assess the applicability of the workaround for your SAP landscape:

1. **Withdraw Authorization:**
   - Revoke authorization `S_START` with values `GRMG_JWS` and `GRMG_AWS_SETUP_TABLE`.

2. **Disable Services:**
   - Disable services `GRMG_JWS` and `GRMG_AWS_SETUP_TABLE` in transaction SICF.

*Note:* This workaround is temporary. It is strongly recommended to implement the correction instructions provided in this SAP Note.
