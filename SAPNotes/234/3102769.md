SAP Security Note 3102769: CVE-2021-42063 XSS Vulnerability in SAP Knowledge Warehouse

**Symptom**

**UPDATE 13th June 2023**: This note has been re-released with updated "Support Packages & Patches" information for releases 7.31 and 7.40.

**UPDATE 23rd August 2022**: This note has been re-released with updated 'Solution' information. The workaround information is moved to new SAP Note [3221696](https://me.sap.com/notes/3221696).

A security vulnerability has been discovered in the SAP Knowledge Warehouse (SAP KW). The usage of one SAP KW component within a web browser enables unauthorized attackers to conduct XSS attacks, which might lead to the disclosure of sensitive data.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The displaying component of SAP KW did not sufficiently validate and encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue.

**Important:** The security breach might also occur if you do not actively use the displaying component of SAP KW. Simply the existence of the component on your landscape is sufficient.

**Solution**

With this correction, the parameters will be properly validated and encoded to prevent a successful XSS attack.

Implement the support packages and patches referenced by this SAP Note.

**Workaround**

If you cannot implement the patch, you have two options for a workaround, which are described in SAP Note [3221696](https://me.sap.com/notes/3221696) "Deactivating of SAP IKS component."

Please assess the workaround applicability for your SAP landscape prior to implementation. Note that this workaround is a temporary fix and is not a permanent solution. SAP strongly recommends applying the corrections outlined in the security note, which can be done in lieu of the workaround or after the workaround is implemented.
