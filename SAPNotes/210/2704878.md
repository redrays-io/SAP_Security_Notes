2704878 - [CVE-2018-2497] Event not logged in SAP HANA database audit log

**Description**

### Symptom
The security audit log of SAP HANA does not log SELECT events if these events are part of a statement with the syntax `CREATE TABLE <table_name> AS SELECT`.

### Other Terms
SAP HANA, security audit log, policies, [CVE-2018-2497](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-2497)

### Reason and Prerequisites
SAP HANA administrators can define in audit policies which events should be logged. Events for `CREATE TABLE <table_name> AS SELECT` are not logged as SELECT statements, even if the SELECT statement should be logged.

### Solution
The `CREATE TABLE <table_name> AS SELECT` event is logged by the audit action "SELECT". The improvement is implemented with the following versions:
- Revision 122.17 (for SAP HANA 1.00 SPS12)
- Revision 24.01 (for SAP HANA 2.0 SPS02)
- Revision 30 (initial shipment of SAP HANA 2.0 SPS03)

Update to these or later versions.
