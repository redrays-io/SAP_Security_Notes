1446276 - CTC: Table White Lists and Authorization Checks

**Symptom**
You are using Central Technical Configuration (CTC templates) to install, configure, or update your system. These templates could pose a security risk and should be secured appropriately.

**Other Terms**
CTC, LM Automation

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Several ABAP-based functions used by CTC templates contain content that could be used maliciously.

**Solution**
Implement this note to secure function modules used by the Central Technical Configuration environment.

If you apply the note manually, you must also create the following messages in message class `S_LMCFG_LIB` using transaction SE91:
- **026:** No permission to view content of table &1
- **027:** No permission to write content of table &1
- **028:** No permission to truncate content of table &1
- **029:** Table operation &1 not provided
- **030:** No authorization to view content of table &1
- **031:** No authorization to write content of table &1
- **032:** No authorization to truncate content of table &1
- **033:** No authorization for client-independent changes

All internal CTC-related function modules are protected by authorization object `S_CTC`. To grant permissions, assign role `SAP_BC_CTC` to the (administration) user if necessary.
