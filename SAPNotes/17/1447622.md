### Description

#### Symptom
Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BSPs GADGET_CREATOR and GADGET_STARTER.

The BSPs GADGET_CREATOR and GADGET_STARTER can be abused by a malicious user allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected Cross Site Scripting, XSS, GADGET_CREATOR, GADGET_STARTER

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within the BSPs GADGET_CREATOR and GADGET_STARTER do not sufficiently encode INPUT and OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross site scripting issue. A reflected cross site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross site scripting can be used to steal another user’s authentication information such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use this to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. In case of an administrator being impersonated, a full compromise of the application’s security may occur.

### Solution
The problem is solved with SAP_BASIS 7.02 SP 4. Alternatively, the attached coding correction can be implemented in advance.
