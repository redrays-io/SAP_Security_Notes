### Title
**1447671 - Cross Site Scripting in BSP**

### Description

#### Symptom
Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BSPs WDR_TEST_SUS_B. The BSPs WDR_TEST_SUS_B can be abused by a malicious user allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected Cross Site Scripting, XSS, WDR_TEST_SUS_B

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within the BSPs WDR_TEST_SUS_B do not sufficiently encode INPUT and OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross site scripting issue. A reflected cross site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a web site. Reflected cross site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use this to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. In case of an administrator being impersonated, a full compromise of the application's security can occur.

#### Solution
The problem is solved with the next Support Package. Alternatively, the attached coding correction can be implemented in advance.
