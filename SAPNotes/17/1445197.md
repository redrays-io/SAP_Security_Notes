SAP Security Note 1445197 - HTTPS/SSL communication

**Description**

The Principal Selector dialog and the Identity Browser were not enabled for SSL/HTTPS/Secure communication with the server.

**Symptom**

Secure communication option is not enabled in Process Composer.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The Principal Selector dialog and the Identity Browser were not enabled for SSL/HTTPS/Secure communication with the server.

**Prerequisites:**
- The SAP AS Java server must be configured for SSL. Refer to the [SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java Security Guide](https://me.sap.com/SAPIKS2/contentShow.sap?_SCLASS=IWB_STRUCT&_SLOIO=44D9586D3EF05F4DE10000000A11466F&TMP_IWB_TASK=PREVIEW2&RELEASE=7321&LANGUAGE=EN&_SEQNUM=1190&_LOIO=57D8BFCF38F66F48B95CE1F52B3F5184&_CLASS=IWB_EXTHLP).
- After configuration, verify in SAP MC/SAP MMC that the ICM and sapstartsrv services reflect HTTPS entries under the `<SID> - Access Points`. If the sapstartsrv service does not show an HTTPS entry, go to `<SID>` on the left side → right-click → All Tasks → Restart Services.
- In NWDS, navigate to Windows → Preferences → SAP AS Java. Add the desired server by providing the IP address/Hostname, instance number, and optionally select the "Use HTTPS" option. Ensure the server is added successfully.
- In NWDS → Windows → Preferences → Secure Storage → Content Tab, delete any stored usernames and passwords used for the server added above.
- Import the SSL certificate into the SUN JDK default certificate store "cacerts" using the `keytool` utility:
  1. Make the certificate available on your client location.
  2. Open Command Prompt and navigate to `<SUN JDK root>\jre\bin`.
  3. Execute:
     ```
     keytool -importcert -file <certificate file location on client> -keystore <SUN JDK root>\jre\lib\security\cacerts
     ```
  4. When prompted, enter the password "changeit".
  - Alternatively, for Vista OS, use the Java Control Panel (found in Windows Control Panel) → Security → Certificates to import your certificates under the "Secure Site CA".

**Solution**

The Principal Selector dialog and the Identity Browser tool have been adapted and tested to enable secure communication with the server. You can now select the "Secure Communication" option at the login prompt in NWDS, ensuring that communication between Process Composer and the server occurs securely. No changes have been made to the previous functionality of these tools.
