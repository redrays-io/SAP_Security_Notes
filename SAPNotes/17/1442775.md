### Description

#### Symptom
The SRM SUS could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Within SUS, the input parameters are not sufficiently encoded, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. It can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access the application with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the application's security could be fully compromised.

#### Solution
Implement the attached correction instructions.
