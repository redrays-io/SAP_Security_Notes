1443367 - Potential disclosure of authentication information

**Symptom**
The "Messaging System Monitor" can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
- Security Update
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Some pages within the "Messaging System Monitor" do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. This vulnerability can be exploited to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. It can also be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a website.

An attacker who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, it may lead to a full compromise of the application's security.

**Solution**
The described security vulnerability is corrected in the following (and newer) Support Packages:
- 3.0 SP27
- 7.00 SP23
- 7.01 SP08
- 7.02 SP04
- 7.10 SP11
- 7.11 SP05
- 7.30 SP00

For older Support Packages, the correction is available as a patch. Please update the software components of the Adapter Engine to the patch levels maintained in section "SP Patch Level" of this note or use newer versions.
