## SAP Security Note 1444840 - Client access to HTTP ABAP server is not checked

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** September 14, 2010  
**Component:** Basis Components > Middleware > Internet Communication Framework

### Symptom

External accesses via HTTP can be executed without the definition of a client assignment. If a client is sent with the request, the system may consider this client during the logon, among other things. Therefore, the caller does not have to be linked to a client and may be able to access each client if the relevant logon information of the different clients is known to the caller.

### Solution

Use the Internet Communication Framework (ICF) to link clients to a virtual host and define a fixed assignment for the caller. By creating a virtual host for each client and setting this client as mandatory in the logon data, the system automatically assigns the client when the virtual host is accessed. This ensures that each request to a specific virtual host is linked to the correct client. Ensure that the preceding software layers (such as the Internet Communication Manager and the network level) are appropriately configured in addition to setting up the virtual hosts.
