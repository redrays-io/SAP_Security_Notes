**Title**
1444282 - gw/reg_no_conn_info settings

**Description**
### Symptom
This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see security notes [1633982](https://me.sap.com/notes/1633982) and [1697971](https://me.sap.com/notes/1697971).

Other SAP Notes refer to the parameter `gw/reg_no_conn_info` to configure the security settings of the gateway. These SAP Notes do not provide any concrete values for the parameter, however.

### Other Terms
Security, gwrd, reg_no_conn_info, IP, Connect, Accpt, restart

### Reason and Prerequisites
The value for the parameter `gw/reg_no_conn_info` can activate or deactivate certain security aspects in the gateway. Since the other SAP Notes define whether the parameter value affects the activation or deactivation of other security-relevant SAP Notes, the parameter is described in this SAP Note.

### Solution
**Description of the parameter**
- The parameter `gw/reg_no_conn_info` can be a positive integer. It is used as a bit mask.
- Each security-relevant SAP Note that can be activated by `gw/reg_no_conn_info` (see the list below), contributes a value of X to the total value. The sum of all values (that is, the SAP Notes for which you want to activate the function) provides the value of the parameter.

**Value X Note Short Text**
```
0       -(no additional security active)
1       1298433 Bypassing security in reginfo & secinfo
2       1434117 Bypassing sec_info without reg_info
4       1465129 CANCEL registered programs
8       1473017 Uppercase/lowercase in the files reg_info and sec_info
16      1480644 gw/acl_mode versus gw/reg_no_conn_info
32      1633982 Update #1 for Security Note 1444282 (NEW: October 2011)
64      1697971 GW: Enhancement when starting external programs (NEW: March 2012)
128     1848930 GW: Strong gw/proxy_check (NEW: April 2014)
```

If you activate the functions of all security-relevant SAP Notes, you must add all of the values in the column X to activate the highest level of security. However, you **MUST** note the advanced steps that are required (for example, adjustments in the files `sec_info` and `reg_info`) to ensure that the activation is problem-free.

**Examples**
1. You want to activate the functions from Note 1298433 (X=1) but you do not want to activate the functions from Note 1434117. Therefore, you must set `gw/reg_no_conn_info` to 1.
2. If `gw/reg_no_conn_info` has the value 3, the functions from SAP Notes 1298433 (X=1) and 1434117 (X=2) are activated. To deactivate the functions from Note 1298433, you must set `gw/reg_no_conn_info` to 2.
3. At present, ALL security fixes that have been made up to now are activated with `gw/reg_no_conn_info` 255 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1.
