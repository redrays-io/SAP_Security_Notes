SAP Security Note 1694080 - Unauthorized Modification of PLM-CFO Content

**Overview**

SAP Security Note [1694080](https://me.sap.com/notes/1694080) addresses a critical vulnerability in the PLM-CFO component that allows unauthorized users to modify displayed application content. This issue stems from reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insufficient encoding of input and output parameters.

**Impact**

A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability to:
- Modify displayed content without authorization.
- Steal authentication information from legitimate users.
- Impersonate users, potentially leading to full compromise of the application's security, especially if an administrator's credentials are targeted.
