1693219 - Unauthorized modification of content in WS_DESIGN_TOOL

**Description**

**Symptom**

The application WS_DESIGN_TOOL in the CRM WebClient UI can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

Reflected cross-site-scripting, XSS

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The application WS_DESIGN_TOOL within the CRM WebClient UI does not sufficiently encode the URL for display of ATP results, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Implement the source code corrections for your release.
