1694074 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in PLM-CFO(8)

**Description**

The PLM-CFO can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
- Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
- PLM-CFO
- cFolders

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages within the PLM-CFO do not sufficiently encode input and output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross site scripting issue. A reflected cross site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Such an attack can steal another user's authentication information, including data related to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, it may lead to a full compromise of the application's security.
