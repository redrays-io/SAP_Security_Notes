**SAP Security Note 1694078: Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in PLM-CFO**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** May 8, 2012  
**Component:** [Product Lifecycle Management > Collaboration Folders (PLM-CFO)](https://me.sap.com/mynotes?tab=Search&sortBy=Relevance&filters=themk%25253Aeq~'PLM*'%25252BreleaseStatus%25253Aeq~'CustomerRelease'%25252BsecurityPatchDay%25253Aeq~'NotRestricted'%25252BfuzzyThreshold%25253Aeq~'0.9'&flag=mynotes)

### Symptom
The PLM-CFO can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Reflected Cross Site Scripting, XSS, PLM-CFO, cFolders

### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within the PLM-CFO do not sufficiently encode input and output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross site scripting issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website or to steal user authentication information. This can lead to impersonation of users, including administrators, potentially compromising the application's security.
