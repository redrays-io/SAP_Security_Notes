1072946 - Gateway: Bypassing monitor commands

## Symptom

The gateway monitor allows only local monitoring when you set the parameter `gw/monitor = 1`. However, it also allows some remote monitoring.

These are:

1. Displaying the release information
2. Displaying connection information
3. Displaying connection handle information (conversation ID)

## Other Terms

- `gw/monitor`

## Reason and Prerequisites

Some transactions and reports try to display information about a remote system. Up to now, this information was ranked as not relevant for security. This ranking has been revised after a new security study.

## Solution

The gateway does not allow queries from remote systems when you set the parameter `gw/monitor=1`. These changes are active with the following patch levels:

- **7.00:** 116
- **6.40:** 194

For these releases, the default of the parameter is still set to `gw/monitor=2` and must also be set to `1`. You can call transaction `SMGW` and choose **Goto → Parameters → Change** to do this dynamically (without restarting the instance). However, you must also make the change permanently in transaction `RZ10` (instance profile parameter maintenance).

As a result, certain function modules (for example, the number of registered programs or querying the list of all connections) may report the error `GWY_MONITOR_DISABLED`.
