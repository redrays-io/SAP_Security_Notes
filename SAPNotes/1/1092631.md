1092631 - Remote vulnerabilities in SAP GUI for Windows

**Symptom**

A possible security exploit, such as a buffer overrun, has been discovered in a component of SAP GUI for Windows. This vulnerability can potentially allow remote attackers to gain control over a PC.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

A buffer overrun is a severe programming error that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code and gain remote control over a system. This vulnerability affects the SAP GUI for Windows, making it crucial to address promptly.

**Solution**

SAP is taking this issue seriously and has implemented several measures to protect customers:

1. **Quality Assurance and Security Reviews**: SAP has established QA processes and security reviews to detect vulnerabilities. However, these measures cannot guarantee the complete absence of buffer overruns.

2. **Setting the "Kill Bit"**: 
   - SAP is implementing the "kill bit" for all files associated with SAP GUI for Windows starting from version 7.10 patch level 12 (most files were already covered in patch level 11).
   - The "kill bit" prevents SAP GUI files from being instantiated on web pages in Microsoft Internet Explorer, mitigating the risk of exploitation through web browsers.
   - This measure does not affect the functionality of SAP GUI within the SAP Enterprise Portal.

**Recommended Actions for Customers**

To reduce the risk of an attack, customers should take the following steps:

- **Upgrade SAP GUI for Windows**: 
  - Upgrade to SAP GUI for Windows version 7.10 or higher (at least patch level 11). 
  - This release is built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, which includes enhanced security features.

- **Apply the Latest Patches**: 
  - Ensure that SAP GUI is updated to the latest available patch. 
  - SAP continually improves the security of SAP GUI, and the latest versions offer the highest level of protection.

- **Apply Registry Files for "Kill Bits"**: 
  - Download and apply the registry files provided in the attachment to set the "kill bits" manually.
