### Description

This security note addresses the authorization checks required when executing executable programs (reports) via transactions SE38 or SE80 in the standard SAP system. Specifically, it ensures that the `S_PROGRAM` authorization object is checked only if an authorization group is assigned to the report.

**Key Features:**
1. **Execution Permissions:** Users with display or change authorization can execute a report if it's not assigned to any authorization group.
2. **Navigation Execution:** Users can execute programs through various navigation steps in SE38 or SE80, provided the program isn't assigned to an authorization group.
3. **Stricter Authorization Check:** Implementation involves modifying the function module `EXTENDED_AUTH_CHECK_FOR_REPS` to enforce stricter authorization checks.

### Solution

- **For SAP Releases 4.6B to 7.00:**
  1. Use transaction SE91 to create message number 322 in the ED message class with the text: "You are not authorized to execute reports in SE80/SE38".
  2. Create or modify the function module `EXTENDED_AUTH_CHECK_FOR_REPS` within function group S38E with specific import and export parameters.

- **For SAP Release 7.10 and Later:**
  The authorization check in `EXTENDED_AUTH_CHECK_FOR_REPS` is active by default. No manual changes are required.
