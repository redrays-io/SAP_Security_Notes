1563239 - Potential remote code execution in SAP BOE

## Description

The SAP Business Objects Enterprise application could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users. Additionally, the application contains a potential remote code execution vulnerability.

### Other Terms

- Buffer overrun
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Reason and Prerequisites

Pages within the SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise application do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. This vulnerability can be exploited to:

- **Deface or Modify Content:** Non-permanently alter displayed content on a website.
- **Steal Authentication Information:** Harvest user session data to impersonate users, potentially leading to unauthorized access with the same privileges as the targeted user. If an administrator is impersonated, the application's security could be fully compromised.
- **Execute Malicious Code:** The buffer overflow vulnerability allows injection of code into the working memory, which can be executed by the application, causing it to terminate unexpectedly.

### Solution

Customers should install **Fixpack 3.5** to address these vulnerabilities.
