SAP Security Note 1562545 - Display user in FS-PMA

---

**Title:** 1562545 - Display user in FS-PMA  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Master Language:** German  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.03.2011  
**Component:** Financial Services > Policy Management Auto (FS-PMA)

### Symptom
1. In FS-PM Auto, the authorizations for some transactions cannot be restricted to "read" only. As a result, each user who is authorized to execute the transactions automatically receives the right to make changes.
2. Some transactions are not secured using authorization objects, preventing restriction of execution authorization. If a user knows the transaction codes, they can change data without proper authorization.
3. There are unsecured obsolete transactions in the system, allowing users to enter inconsistent data if they know the transaction codes.

**Other Terms:** Authorization, Display, Security hole, Auto line of business

### Reason and Prerequisites
1. The authorization objects of the affected transactions do not allow users to explicitly request change rights.
2. Missing authorization objects cause the inability to restrict execution authorization.
3. Obsolete transactions remain unsecured in the system.

### Solution

**History:**  
Version 1 from 28-Feb-11: New

To correct the problem, implement the source code corrections and perform the following manual tasks. Support Package [SAPK-11001INFSPMAUTO](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPK-11001INFSPMAUTO) corrects the problem.

**Steps:**

1. **Add a new authorization object:**
   - Call transaction `SU21`.
   - Select folder "6VPM" in the menu tree.
   - In the application toolbar, go to the "Change" pushbutton and select "Authorization Object".
   - Enter the following data:
     - **Object:** `/MVA/6VIAA`
     - **Text:** Authorizations for IC Management (AT)
     - **Class:** 6VPM
   - In the authorization fields list, enter `ACTVT` in the first row.
   - Deselect the "Authorization object is relevant to SAP_NEW" indicator.
   - Create documentation for the authorization object:
     - **Definition:** This authorization object controls the authorizations within FS-PM Auto IC Management (Austrian procedure).
     - **Fields:** Only `ACTVT` is used to specify authorizations:
       - **Change (02):** Allows processing of IC management records.
       - **Execute (16):** Allows starting IC management.
   - Activate the documentation and save the new authorization object.

2. **Add authorization objects to transactions:**
   - For each transaction (`/MVA/AMC_BMSTART`, `/MVA/AMC_IASTART`, `/MVA/AMC_ICASTART`, `/MVA/AMC_ICDESTART`):
     - Call transaction `SE93`.
     - Enter the transaction code and choose "Change".
     - Enter the corresponding authorization object (e.g., `/MVA/6VBM`) and choose "Values".
     - In the dialog box, enter `16` in the input field and confirm.
     - Save the transaction.

3. **Delete obsolete transactions:**
   - For each obsolete transaction (e.g., `/MVA/AMB_PROCCLAIM`, `/MVA/AMC_ICSTART`, etc.):
     - Call transaction `SE93`.
     - Enter the transaction code and choose "Delete".
     - Repeat for each listed transaction.
