**SAP Security Note 1562064 - Potential denial of service in http provider of Web AS Java**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 4  
**Priority:** HotNews  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** September 13, 2011  
**Component:** Basis Components > NetWeaver Application Server Java > Web Container, HTTP, JavaMail, Servlets

### Description

**Symptom**  
A malicious user can remotely exploit the HTTP service on the dispatcher process of Web AS Java (J2EE), rendering it and potentially the resources used by the dispatcher process unavailable.

**Other Terms**  
DoS, denial of service, HTTP service, connection leak

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
The issue is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can send a specifically crafted request that causes the process to consume excessive resources. Consequently, other processes cannot allocate new resources, rendering the system unavailable. This condition can be intentionally induced by an adversary to cause a Denial of Service.

### Solution

Update to the latest version of SAP Web AS (J2EE). If updating is not possible, apply one of the patches listed in the **SP Patch Level** section of the note.
