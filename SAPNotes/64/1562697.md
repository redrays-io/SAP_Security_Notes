## SAP Security Note 1562697 - Authorization group for trust relationship

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 7  
**Released On:** 17.08.2015  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Category:** Program error  
**Component:** Basis Components > Middleware > RFC

### Description

**Symptom**

This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see security note 2205521.

Due to insufficient authorization checks, a read access to the RFC table `RFCSYSACL` may be granted.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The table `RFCSYSACL` was not assigned to an authorization group that is dedicated.

**Solution**

Import the attached Support Package or follow the manual instructions below.

### Correction Instructions

```
1. In your Customizing client, call transaction SE54, select the field "Authorization Groups", and choose "Create/Change". Use F5 ("New Entries") to create a new entry with the following values:

        AuGr: TTRL
        Description: Trust Relationships

    Save the new entry. (For SAP_BASIS Releases lower than 8.00 (except for Release 7.2L), a Customizing request is required for this.)

2. In your Workbench client, call transaction SE54, select the field "Assign Authoriz. Group", and choose "Display". Select the field "Authorization Group" and implement your selection. In the next dialog box, enter "TTRL" as the "Authorization Group". Choose "Enter", and assign the table `RFCSYSACL` to the authorization group as follows:

        Table: RFCSYSACL
        Authorization: TTRL

3. Verify your authorization concept with regard to the new table authorization group. Ensure that no user is granted general table access to a table with the authorization group "TTRL".

    To do this, you can use the report RSUSR002. Execute the report and enter the authorization object `S_TABU_DIS` in the "Selection by values" area. Choose "Enter", enter the value "TTRL" in the search field, and execute the report. To determine the responsible roles or profiles for the results list, you can use the SUIM reports for these areas in the same way.
```
