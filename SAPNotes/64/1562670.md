**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3

**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** April 12, 2011

### Description

#### Symptom
A malicious user can execute functions in SAP Business Connector 4.8 without authentication and authorization.

#### Other Terms
Cross-site request forgery (XSRF), Token, Session Riding

#### Reason and Prerequisites
SAP Business Connector 4.8 executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. A malicious user can trick an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a specific URL and parameters, causing the function to execute with the authenticated user's privileges. This can be achieved through cross-site scripting attacks or by presenting a crafted link to the victim.

#### Solution
Token support has been introduced in Business Connector 4.8 with CoreFix 4 and Service Release 6. To mitigate this vulnerability, apply these patch levels or higher to your SAP Business Connector 4.8 installation. Refer to the referenced SAP Notes for instructions on obtaining and applying the latest CoreFix and Service Release.

For more detailed information about the XSRF vulnerability and its resolution in the Business Connector, consult the latest version of the [SAP BC Security Best Practices Guide 4.8](https://me.sap.com/sbc-download) under Documentation, chapter 11.

**Additional Recommendation:**  
Review all Access Control Lists (ACLs) and specifically remove the Administrator group from all ACLs protecting services related to business processes.
