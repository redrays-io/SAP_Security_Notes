1560606 - Missing authorization check in UME Access Control List API

**Description**
An authenticated user can use functions of the User Management Engine Access Control List (ACL) API to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Affected Components**
- **Basis Components > NetWeaver Application Server Java > Security, User Management > ACLs, J2EE Roles, UME Actions** (BC-JAS-SEC-AUT)

**Solution**
To address this security vulnerability, you should deploy the latest patch for your corresponding product and service pack from the SAP Service Marketplace:

- **SERVERCORE.SCA** (for releases 7.10 and higher)
- **SAP-JEECOR.SCA** (for releases 6.40 and 7.0)
- **SAP-JEE.SCA** (for releases lower than 6.40)

Additionally, as a workaround, applications using the User Management Engine ACL API can implement their own ACL owner check before calling interface methods that modify or delete an ACL.
