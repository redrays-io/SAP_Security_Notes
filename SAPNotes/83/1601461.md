SAP Security Note 1601461 - Update #1 to Security Note 866020

## Overview
**SAP Note 1601461** is an update to **Security Note 866020**, focusing on enhancing web encoding methods to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This update aligns with the latest OWASP recommendations to ensure secure handling of user inputs in SAP applications.

## Symptom
User inputs in Internet applications might execute unintended external source code (e.g., JavaScript) if not properly encoded. This can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

## Reason and Prerequisites
### Reason for Encoding
Direct display of user inputs without proper encoding can allow the execution of malicious code in web applications.

### Prerequisites
- Implementation of encoding methods as described in [SAP Note 866020](https://me.sap.com/notes/866020).

## Solution
To mitigate XSS risks, all external user inputs or content from external sources should be encoded before being displayed in a web browser. The updated XSS encoding methods are as follows:

### ABAP (Refer to [SAP Note 1582870](https://me.sap.com/notes/1582870))
- Use the class `CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG` which contains the XSS encoding methods.

### C/C++ (Refer to [SAP Note 1582867](https://me.sap.com/notes/1582867))
- Internal SAP functions are available for XSS encoding.

### JAVA (Refer to [SAP Note 1590008](https://me.sap.com/notes/1590008))
- Utilize the J2EE/JEE security library class `tc_sec_csi.jar` for encoding.

Ensure that your SAP system is updated with the relevant support packages as mentioned in the notes above.
