1602143 - Hard-coded credentials in CRM-ISA

**Description**

**Symptom**  
An attacker can be authenticated to CRM-ISA without having their own legitimate credentials, or they may escalate privileges.

**Other Terms**  
Backdoor, hard-coded, credentials, CRM-ISA, Null Password, Web Channel, Internet Sales, Internet Service, isa, ECo, E-Commerce, WebChannel, CRM, ERP, r3, r/3, ECC

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
The vulnerability is caused by a hard-coded username and password combination in the program's source code. An attacker who specifies these credentials can log on to the system without having been assigned legitimate access by the system administrator(s). If a user already has privileges with which they can log on, an escalation of privileges may be possible if the hard-coded account has higher access rights than the original user.

**Solution**  
This note contains Java correction(s) for E-Commerce and Web Channel.
