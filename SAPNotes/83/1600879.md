**Overview**

- **SAP Note Number:** 1600879
- **Title:** CA-DMS: Potential Directory Traversal
- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Released On:** February 14, 2012
- **Priority:** Correction with high priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer
- **Component:** Cross-Application Components > Document Management (CA-DMS)
- **Version:** 3

**Symptom**

The Document Management System (DMS) contains a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to potentially write arbitrary files on the remote server. This could lead to data corruption or alteration of system behavior.

**Other Terms**

- OPEN DATASET
- SEC-136
- pf_file
- FILE_VALIDATE_NAME
- Path Traversal

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Certain function modules and subroutines in Document Management fail to validate the path where a user-submitted file is written. This oversight allows an attacker to overwrite data on the remote system.
