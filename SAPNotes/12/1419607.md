### Description

#### Symptom
This note involves several changes required to comply with the current security product standards for XI/PI.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
**Product Standard Conformance**

This note provides countermeasures/corrections to protect two assets: business sensitive information and user credentials from unauthorized users.

- **Protecting business sensitive information**  
  The payload content view of the messaging system monitor is protected by web role (UME action) "content" of application com.sap.aii.af.ms.app. Previously, anyone with the standard monitor user role was able to view not only the message headers but also the message payload contents that may contain business sensitive information.

- **Protecting credentials**  
  The authorization HTTP header is not persisted with the message. Previously, the complete HTTP headers were persisted including the authentication headers that may reveal user credentials.

#### Solution
Please refer to the details of this note to find out the relevant service package versions.
