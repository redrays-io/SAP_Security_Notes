### Description

#### Symptom
When the customer has set up External encryption and an error occurs for some reason, the error is not propagated. Instead, the system suppresses the error and performs internal encryption in SAP GUI. This leads customers to believe that External encryption was successful, even though an error has occurred. This scenario occurs in transaction BP when creating payment card data.

#### Other Terms
PCA_MASTER, PCA_SECURITY_RAW, External Encryption, CRC Error = 13, SSFN_KRN_ENVELOPE, CL_PCA_SECURITY, CREATE_GUID

#### Reason and Prerequisites
This issue is due to a program error. According to standards, whenever an error occurs during External encryption, the error should be notified to the end user.

#### Solution
Apply the source code changes provided in the security note to resolve the error.
