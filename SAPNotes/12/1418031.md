1418031 - Potential Security Issues in SAP Solution Manager

---

### Description

**Symptom**

This SAP Note addresses security issues in the Implementation part of SAP Solution Manager (component SV-SMG-IMP*). The following risks are mitigated:

- **Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**
  
  Malicious users can exploit XSS vulnerabilities to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

- **SQL Injection**

  Specially crafted inputs can allow malicious users to execute arbitrary database commands, enabling them to retrieve, modify, or delete data stored by the system.

- **Hard-coded User Names (Backdoor)**
  
  The system contains hard-coded usernames that alter the program's behavior upon successful authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

- **Affected Release:** SAP Solution Manager ST400
- **Fixed Versions and Patch Levels:** ST400 SP23

**Solution**

Implement this SAP Note via Note Assistant (transaction **SNOTE**).
