SAP Security Note 1420281: Deactivate &SAP_EDIT in SE16N to Enhance Security

**Overview**

SAP Security Note [1420281](https://me.sap.com/notes/1420281) addresses a critical vulnerability associated with the `&SAP_EDIT` function in transaction SE16N. Originally designed to allow SAP Support experts to assist customers swiftly by enabling change mode, this function inadvertently became a security risk due to unauthorized access.

**Details**

- **Symptom:** The `&SAP_EDIT` function in SE16N allowed users with certain authorizations to switch to change mode, which was not intended for all users.
  
- **Reason:** Although `&SAP_EDIT` was protected by high-level developer authorization, its availability on the internet led to unauthorized access and potential security breaches within customer environments.

- **Solution:** Implementing this security note will completely deactivate the `&SAP_EDIT` function, thereby eliminating the risk of unauthorized changes through SE16N.

**Implementation**

You can implement this security enhancement using SNOTE or by downloading the patch directly:
