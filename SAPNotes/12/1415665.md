### Description

#### Symptom
A user might tamper with a search result list using specially crafted inputs for certain search criteria in the Solution Documentation Assistant.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The issue is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code constructs a `WHERE` clause that includes strings manipulable by a malicious user. This manipulated SQL statement can be used to retrieve additional information from the database.

#### Solution
Replace the dynamic `WHERE` clause with a fixed `WHERE` clause. Import the relevant Solution Manager Support Package or use the [SAP Note Assistant](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/notes) to implement this SAP Security Note.
