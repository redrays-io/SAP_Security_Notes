2602928 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in SAP CRM WebClient UI Text Editors

**Symptom**
SAP CRM WebClient UI does not sufficiently validate and/or encode hidden fields, resulting in a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impacts of XSS Vulnerability:**
- Non-permanent defacement or modification of displayed content on a website.
- Theft of user authentication information, such as data related to the current session.
- Impersonation of the user to access all information with the same rights as the target user.

**Other Terms:**
XSS, DOM-based XSS, CSS, hidden field, BTF Editor, RTE, Rich Text Editor

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Text editors for CRM WebClient UI do not validate/encode some hidden fields. An attacker needs to trick an already authenticated user into visiting a prepared website to launch the attack.
