1469982 - Code injection vulnerability in ECC and SAP R/3

**Symptom**

SAP R/3 4.6, Enterprise R/3 4.7, ECC 5.00, ECC 6.00 - 6.04 contain code which allows the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice. A malicious user can therefore control the behavior of the system or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without legitimate credentials.

**Other Terms**

Backdoor, injection, run, credentials, SAP R/3, SAP R/3 Enterprise, ECC 5.00, ECC 6.00 - 6.04, SAP_HR, SAP_HRXX

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The program code contains a possibility to define and execute code of the user's choice, which changes the system's behavior. A valid and authenticated user with authorization for transaction SA38 or SE38 is required. Although the vulnerability is caused by code belonging to SAP_HR, the injection is not restricted to this component as the injected code can affect any other component of the system.

Apply the attached correction instructions or implement the HR support packages in which the corrections have been included.
