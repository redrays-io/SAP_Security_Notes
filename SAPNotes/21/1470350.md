### Title
**1470350 - Code Injection Vulnerability/Missing Auth-Check in SRM**

### Description

#### Symptom
The Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) solution contains code that allows the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice. A malicious user can control the system's behavior or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without legitimate credentials.

An authenticated user can access functionalities in SRM that should be restricted, potentially resulting in privilege escalation.

#### Other Terms
SRM, Supplier Relationship Management, procurement, E-Commerce, Web, EBP, SRM_SERVER, Security vulnerability, Dynamic Function call, Backdoor, injection, run, credentials, Authorization, authorization check

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The program code allows users to define and execute arbitrary code, altering the system's behavior. Depending on the injected code, users can obtain unauthorized information, modify or delete data, alter system output, create users with higher privileges, or perform denial of service attacks.

Additionally, the application lacks proper permission checks for certain functionalities, leading to undesired system behavior.
