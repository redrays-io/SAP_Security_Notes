   - Follow the manual steps outlined in the attached document [update_system.doc](https://me.sap.com/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012003146900000262112010&iv_version=0006&iv_guid=85528E4E8358DE469581AAA7209E003E) contained within [Update_System.zip](https://me.sap.com/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012003146900000262112010&iv_version=0006&iv_guid=85528E4E8358DE469581AAA7209E003E).
