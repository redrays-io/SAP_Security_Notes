1467896 - Unauthorized use of application functions in ICM

**Description:**

**Symptom:**
A malicious user can execute functions in the Internet Communication Manager (ICM) without proper authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms:**
Cross-site request forgery (XSRF), ICM

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
ICM executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. A malicious user can trick an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a particular URL and specific parameters. This causes the function to execute with the privileges of the authenticated user. To successfully carry out this attack, the malicious user must meet special requirements, such as performing a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or presenting a deceptive link to the victim.

**Solution:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, apply the necessary ICM patches as detailed in the "SP patch level" section of the SAP Security Note. Ensure that your ICM is updated to the specified patch levels or higher.
