1471118 - Information disclosure relating to server info

**Symptom**

A malicious user can discover information relating to the SAP Java Web Application Server (WAS). The information accidentally disclosed above is only a dummy value and hence doesn't have any major impact.

**Other Terms**

Information disclosure, Web Dynpro, wdResMod.bat, SDM.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Information such as the Software Deployment Manager (SDM) user passwords can be discovered through the use of a batch file named `wdResMod.bat`, residing on the SAP Java Web Application Server's filesystem. The password disclosed here is only a dummy value and not the actual SDM password.

**Solution**

The issue described above has been fixed by removing the `wdResMod.bat` file altogether as this file is not relevant for SAP customers.

The above fix will be available in the latest Support Package (SP) of WebDynpro for Java on all releases. In the section "SP Patch Level," you can find information on which patches contain the respective correction. Please install this patch or a newer one as WebDynpro patches are always cumulative.
