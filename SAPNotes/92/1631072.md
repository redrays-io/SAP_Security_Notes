1631072 - Potential modification of persisted data by RDDNT4DL

---

### **Symptom**
An attacker can exploit the program `RDDNT4DL` and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, resulting in the modification of data persisted by the system.

### **Other Terms**
- SQL injection
- Database
- RDDNT4DL

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by an attacker. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to modify information in the database. This may affect tables that have fields similar to those in the tables DDXTT and DDXTF.

### **Solution**
Import one of the attached requests if the program is in the system.
