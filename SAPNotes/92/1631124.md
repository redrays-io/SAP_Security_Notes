### Title
Potential modification of persisted data by RDDCP6TB

### Description
**Symptom:**  
An attacker can exploit the program `RDDCP6TB` and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, resulting in the modification of data persisted by the system.

**Other Terms:**  
SQL injection, database, RDDCP6TB

**Reason and Prerequisites:**  
The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by an attacker. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to modify information in the database. This may affect tables that have fields similar to those in the tables `TRESN` and `TRESC`.

### Solution
Import one of the attached requests if the program is in the system. You can ignore warnings that concern the differing component vector.  
This problem does not occur for Enhancement Package 1 for SAP NetWeaver 7.30. All of the new EHPI and SUM versions also deliver the solution automatically.

**Manual Activities:**  
There are manual activities that need to be performed, detailed in the attached SAR files.
