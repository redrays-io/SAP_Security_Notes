1630198 - Potential modification or disclosure of data in LOD-ESO-AS

**Symptom**

An attacker can exploit LOD-ESO-AS and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands. This results in either the retrieval of additional information, or the modification of data persisted by the system.

**Other Terms**

SQL Injection, database, LOD-ESO-AS

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by an attacker. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to retrieve additional data from the database, or to modify the data.

**Solution**

Fixes have been developed and released in version 5.0 J, Version 5.1 Patch 10, and all Version 7.0 SP and patch versions. Update to the appropriate Release/Patch version to mitigate this risk.
