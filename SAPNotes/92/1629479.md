# SAP Security Note 1629479 - Unauthorized Use of Application Functions in BSP Application

**Release Date:** November 8, 2011  
**Component:** Basis Components > Business Server Pages (BC-BSP)  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer

## Description

### Symptom

A malicious user can execute functions in BSP applications without authentication and authorization.

### Other Terms

Cross-site request forgery (XSRF), BSP

### Reason and Prerequisites

BSP applications ITMVC2 and JSD_TEST execute certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a specific URL and parameters, the function executes with the authenticated user's rights. This can be achieved through a cross-site scripting attack or by presenting a crafted link to the victim.
