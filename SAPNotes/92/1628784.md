```markdown
**SAP Note/KBA:** 1628784  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Release Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.11.2011  
**Component:** Basis Components > Computer Center Management System (CCMS) > CCMS Monitoring & Alerting

### Description
A malicious user with network access to the web-service of `sapstartsrv` (protocol HTTP, port 5NN13, where NN is an instance number) can cause excessive CPU usage or an out-of-memory condition (denial-of-service) of `sapstartsrv` by sending specially crafted large requests to the SAPCCMS web-interface.

### Reason and Prerequisites
`Sapstartsrv` (SAP Startup Service) provides the functionality of the CCMS agent via the web-service SAPCCMS. The SAPCCMS web-service publishes certain web methods that are, by default, not protected with authorization. Some of these methods allow customers to supply a manipulated request array, which can be exploited to perform a denial-of-service attack on `sapstartsrv` over the network.

### Solution
Additional measures have been implemented to prevent the described attack. The `sapstartsrv` now rejects requests with an error message if a manipulated request array is detected.

**Steps to Apply the Correction:**
1. **Obtain the Correction Package:**
   - Download the correction from the [Download for SNOTE](https://notesdownloads.sap.com/note/0040000017305282017).
2. **Update the Binary:**
   - Apply the `dw.sar` or `saphostagent.sar` package to update the `sapstartsrv` binary.
3. **Restart the Startup Service:**
   - Execute the following command to restart the service:
     ```
     ./sapcontrol -nr NN -function RestartService
     ```
     *(Replace `NN` with your system number)*
