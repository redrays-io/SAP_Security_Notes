1629242 - Missing cross tenant authorization check in LOD-ESO-AS

**SAP Note/KBA:** 1629242  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Release Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 12.06.2012  
**Component:** OnDemand > Sourcing OnDemand > Accounts & Security  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority

### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functions of LOD-ESO-AS belonging to another tenant and thus access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### Other Terms
Cross tenant, authorization check, LOD-ESO-AS

### Reason and Prerequisites
LOD-ESO-AS does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access cross tenant functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

### Solution
Fixes have been developed and released in:
- **Version 5.0 J**
- **Version 5.1 Patch 10**
- **All Version 7.0 SP and patch releases**

Update to the appropriate Release/Patch version to mitigate this risk.
