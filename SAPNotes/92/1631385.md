1631385 - Unauthorized use of application functions in Config Uninstal

**Symptom**
A malicious user can execute functions in the KM Configuration Uninstaller Utility without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
Cross-site request forgery (XSRF), KM Configuration Uninstaller Utility

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The Knowledge Management Configuration Uninstaller Utility executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a specific URL and parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. This can be achieved through a cross-site scripting attack or by presenting a deceptive link to the victim.

**Solution**
1. Deploy the patch containing the XSRF Protection Framework as detailed in [SAP Note 1450166](https://me.sap.com/notes/1450166).
2. Apply the latest patch levels of the Security Correction Advisories (SCAs) as outlined in the [Validity section](https://me.sap.com/notes/1631385#Validity) of this note.
