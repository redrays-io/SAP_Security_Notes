# SAP Security Note 1628849 - Unauthorized Modification of Stored Content in WEBCUIF

**Number:** 1628849  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 5  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 07.01.2013  
**Component:** Cross-Application Components > WebClient User Interface > User Interface > Tag Library

## Description

### Symptom
WEBCUIF can be exploited by an attacker to modify application content, persist the changes without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), WEBCUIF, CRMUIF

### Reason and Prerequisites
WEBCUIF leads to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. This allows attackers to permanently alter displayed content on a website, embedding content that is automatically rendered without needing to target individual victims. Additionally, stored XSS can be used to steal users' authentication information, such as session data. If an attacker gains access to this data, they can impersonate the user and access information with the same permissions. Impersonating an administrator can fully compromise the application's security.
