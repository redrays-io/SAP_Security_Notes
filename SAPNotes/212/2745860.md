SAP Security Note 2745860 - Information Disclosure in Enterprise Services Repository of SAP Process Integration

**Description**

### Symptom
Under certain conditions, Enterprise Services Repository of SAP Process Integration allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted.

Some well-known impacts of Information Disclosure are:
- Loss of information and system configuration confidentiality
- Information gathering for further exploits and attacks

**Change Log:**

**v4 (Current version) - UPDATE 14th May 2024:**
This note has been re-released with updated 'validity' information. There have not been any changes done which require customer action.

**v2 (Initial Version)**

### Other Terms
Information Exposure, Information Leak, SAP Process Orchestration (PO), Enterprise Services Repository (ESR), SAP Process Integration (PI), Secure Network Communications (SNC)

### Reason and Prerequisites
The IDoc/RFC metadata upload from an ABAP backend to Enterprise Services Repository cannot be secured via SNC. This missing capability affects the swing client as well as the Eclipse plug-in.
