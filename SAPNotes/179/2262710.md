2262710 - Denial of service (DOS) vulnerability in HANA DP Agent

### Description

**Symptom**

HANA DP Agent allows an attacker to prevent legitimate users from accessing a service by crashing or flooding the service. Impacts include:

- Long response delays and service interruptions, degrading service quality for legitimate users.
- Direct impact on availability.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 7.5 / 10
- **CVSS v3 Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

**Reason and Prerequisites**

This vulnerability exists in setups using HANA Smart Data Integration (SDI) with HANA DP Agent 1.0 SP1 Patch 2 or prior versions. An attacker can exploit this flaw by triggering a condition that causes the process to enter an endless loop, consuming all available processing time. This results in the entire machine becoming unresponsive until the process is manually terminated, enabling a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

**Solution**

SAP has provided a fix that validates the packet length in the communication before allocating memory in the DP Agent. To mitigate this vulnerability, upgrade HANA SDI DP Agent to:

- **1.0 SP2**
- **1.0 SP1 Patch 3**
