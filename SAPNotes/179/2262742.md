**Reason and Prerequisites**

HANA DP Agent listens to an admin port for local communication with the dpagent config tool. This port is opened for requests from outside the host where it is possible to parse unauthenticated administrative requests and commands.

This condition exists in HANA Smart Data Integration (SDI) with HANA DP Agent 1.0 SP1 patch2 or prior versions.

**Solution**

The fix is to accept connections only from localhost.

Upgrade to HANA DP Agent 1.0 SP2 or 1.0 SP1 patch3 for the fix.
