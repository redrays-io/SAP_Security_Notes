**SAP Note Number**: 1688421  
**Type**: SAP Security Note  
**Version**: 2  
**Released On**: 27.07.2012  
**Component**: Basis Components > Security - Read [KBA 2985997](https://me.sap.com/servicessupport/knowledge/notes/2985997) for subcomponents > Secure Store and Forward  
**Category**: Program error  
**Priority**: Correction with high priority  
**Status**: Released for Customer

### Description

#### Symptom
The BSP applications `SSFDEMODIGSIG` and `SSFDEMODIGSIG2` can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, SSFDEMODIGSIG, SSFDEMODIGSIG2

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within the BSP applications `SSFDEMODIGSIG` and `SSFDEMODIGSIG2` do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another userâ€™s authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

#### Solution
Apply correction.
