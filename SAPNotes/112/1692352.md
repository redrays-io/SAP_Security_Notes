### Title
**1692352 - Unauthorized modification of the content in CRM-MD-BP-CCP**

### Description
#### Symptom
The application component CRM-MD-BP-CCP can be abused by an attacker, allowing unauthorized modification of the displayed application and potential retrieval of authentication information from other legitimate users. This vulnerability arises because the objects of the function group CRM_CCKPT_CFS_SERVICE use the old XSS encoding library. All calls to the methods of the old XSS library must be replaced with calls to the new XSS library.

#### Other Terms
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- CRM-MD-BP-CCP
- CRM_CCKPT_CFS_SERVICE

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The class `CL_HTTP_UTILITY` within the application component CRM-MD-BP-CCP does not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting issue. An attacker can exploit this to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. This stolen data can be used to impersonate the user and access information with the same privileges. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
