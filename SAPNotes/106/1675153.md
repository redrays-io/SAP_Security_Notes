1675153 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BW-BCT-PLA

**Symptom**
BW-BCT-PLA-RAP can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- BW-BCT-PLA-RAP

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The function module `UPARM_ADD_VIEW_TO_XML_STRING` within BW-BCT-PLA-RAP does not sufficiently encode input parameters by utilizing the current XSS library methods for URL encoding. This results in a general cross-site scripting vulnerability. An attacker who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**
Implement the attached correction instructions provided in the SAP Note. Additionally, ensure that the following prerequisite SAP Notes are implemented:
- [Note 1582870 - ABAP XSS Escaping Support](https://me.sap.com/notes/1582870)
- [Note 1582867 - Security options (XSS) for ESCAPE](https://me.sap.com/notes/1582867)
