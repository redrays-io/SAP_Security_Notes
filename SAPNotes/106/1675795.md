**SAP Security Note 1675795**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.05.2012  
**Component:** Project System > Confirmation

### Symptom
Application Component PS can be abused by malicious users, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Cross-site scripting, XSS, PS-CON

### Reason and Prerequisites
ITS Services (CNW1, CNW4) within Application Component PS do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting issue.

Cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.

If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
