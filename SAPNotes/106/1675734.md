**SAP Security Note 1675734 - Unauthorized modification in ITS-Services in BBP**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.05.2012  
**Component:** Supplier Relationship Management > SRM > Catalog Interface

### Description
SRM-EBP-CAT can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Symptom
A malicious user can modify application content and steal authentication information, potentially impersonating users, including administrators, leading to compromised application security.

### Reason and Prerequisites
ITS Services `BBP_FREEFORM` and `BBP_OCI_AGENT` within `SRM-EBP-PRC` do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This can be exploited to steal authentication information and impersonate users.

### Solution
Apply this note or import the changes via the relevant support package. Ensure that corrections from [SAP Note 1621946](https://me.sap.com/notes/1621946) and [SAP Note 1488500](https://me.sap.com/notes/1488500) are also implemented to ensure full protection.

Execute the report `RITS_XSS_PARAM_FORM_OCIAGENT` included in the correction instructions and provide the transport request number when prompted. This report will add service parameters for the adapted ITS services.
