1674905 - Malicious modification of displayed SRM attachments

**Description**

SRM attachments can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

SRM Attachments, Documents and Attachments, Handler class, CL_HTTP_BBP_DOCSERVER, SICF, DOCSERVER, Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, SRM-EBP-CA-ATT, BBP_OUT.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Within SRM attachment functionality, some input and output parameters do not sufficiently encode, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected XSS can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Implement the attached correction or install the corresponding support package.
