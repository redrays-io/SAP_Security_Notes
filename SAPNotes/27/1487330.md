1487330 - Potential remote code execution in SAP Kernel

**Symptom**

This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see [Security Note 1529807](https://me.sap.com/notes/1529807).

A malicious user can exploit Kernel functions to enable them to take complete control of the product, including viewing, changing, or deleting data.

**Other Terms**

Buffer overrun, RCE, Kernel

**Reason and Prerequisites**

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Kernel. This enables a malicious user to inject code into the working memory that is subsequently executed by the application. It can also be used to cause a general fault in the product, thereby producing a termination of the product.

**Solution**

Apply the latest kernel patch with the patch level given in this note at least.
