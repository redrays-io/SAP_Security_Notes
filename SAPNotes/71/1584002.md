### **Title**
1584002 - Unauthorized modification of contents displayed in ICF

### **Description**
Data in the Internet Communication Framework (ICF) can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms:** Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, ICF, Internet Communication Framework

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
API interfaces within the ICF do not sufficiently encode INPUT/OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site. Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### **Solution**
Implement the specified source code corrections by following the relevant correction instructions.
