SAP Security Note 1584972 - Directory traversal in FI-CA

**Overview**

SAP has released Security Note [1584972](https://me.sap.com/notes/1584972) addressing a directory traversal vulnerability in the FI-CA component. This vulnerability allows malicious users to potentially read or write arbitrary files on the remote server, which could lead to unauthorized data access or system corruption.

**Details**

- **Symptom:**  
  Potential directory traversal in the component FI-CA.

- **Other Terms:**  
  Directory traversal, FI-CA, FP-COLLAG.

- **Reason and Prerequisites:**  
  The programs specified in the correction instructions contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited to read arbitrary files, potentially disclosing confidential information. Additionally, some programs may allow writing arbitrary files, possibly leading to data corruption or altered system behavior.

**Affected Components**

- FI-CA component versions: 464, 471, 472, 600, 602, 603, 604, 605.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability, apply the correction instructions provided in [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) before implementing this note. The corrections include:

1. **Maintain Logical File Paths and Names:**  
   Use transaction FILE to define and maintain the following logical file paths and names:
   
   - `FI-CA-COL-INFO` - Information for Collection Agencies
   - `FI-CA-COL-READ` - Information from Collection Agencies
   - `FI-CA-COL-SUB` - Submission to Collection Agencies
   - `FI-CA-COL-TEST` - Test file for Collection Agencies

2. **Support Package Installation:**  
   Ensure the relevant support packages are applied:
   
   - FI-CA 464: SAPKIPC634
   - FI-CA 471: SAPKIPC727
   - FI-CA 472: SAPKIPC821
   - FI-CA 600: SAPK-60020INFICA
   - FI-CA 602: SAPK-60210INFICA
   - FI-CA 603: SAPK-60309INFICA
   - FI-CA 604: SAPK-60410INFICA
