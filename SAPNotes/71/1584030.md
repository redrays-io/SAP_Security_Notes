### Description

#### Symptom
The IPC Knowledge Base Selection available in the SAP E-Commerce Administration Console web application can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score**: 4.3
- **CVSS Base Vector**: AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/).

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The JSP Pages `kbList.jsp`, `kbListMsa.jsp`, `kbProfileMsa.jsp`, `kbHeaderMsa.jsp`, `kbMsa.jsp`, `kbHeader.jsp`, and `kbProfil.jsp` within Development Component `crm/web/ipc` do not sufficiently encode hidden input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Additionally, it can be used to steal another userâ€™s authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights, thereby fully compromising the security of the application.
