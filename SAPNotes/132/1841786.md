1841786 - Unauthorized use of application functions in MSON

**Symptom**

An attacker can execute functions in XAP-MBA-MSO without authentication and authorization.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.0
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://me.sap.com/service.sap.com/securitynotes/) on the SAP Security Notes page.

**Other Terms**

RIMLoginModule, MSON, Security, Protection, HTTP/S request, Cross-site request forgery, XSRF, MSON

**Reason and Prerequisites**

XAP-MBA-MSO executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The attacker may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

**Solution**

The RIM SSO Authentication components and modules were created for an older version of NetWeaver, and this module is irrelevant with the newer versions of NetWeaver 7.0x. Hence, the old RIM SSO components are not supported anymore and have been replaced by the NetWeaver functionality.

The SSO functionality from MSON has been replaced by NetWeaver SSO.

Kindly refer to the [SAP Note 1919464](https://me.sap.com/notes/1919464) for steps to undeploy the RIMLoginModule component.
