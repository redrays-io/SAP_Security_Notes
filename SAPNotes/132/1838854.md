#### Other Terms
Authorization, authorization check, ABAP Report variants, BC-ABA-TO

### Reason and Prerequisites
ABAP Report variants do not contain authorization checks for checking an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

### Solution
Please apply the Support Package mentioned in this SAP Note or the respective correction instruction.

The authorization check for execution of reports (S_PROGRAM) associated with an authorization group (TRDIR-SECU) has been made stricter. For a rare subset of specifically configured reports, the authorization check was not executed in specific submit scenarios, as the authorization was supposed to be performed by the calling program. This behavior has not been changed, validating the authority group also in this specific call scenario.
