SAP Security Note 1842817 - Removal of encrypted data after an update/upgrade process

**Symptom**

During system maintenance using SL Toolset tools (Software Update Manager or Upgrade Master DVD), the `JUpgrade.properties` and `JUpgrade.key` files (created during the procedure) are not deleted after successful execution.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 2.6
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/AU:N/C:P/I:N/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

**Other Terms**

secure store, JUpgrade.properties, JUpgrade.key, key phrase, Software Update Manager, SUM, Java upgrade

**Reason and Prerequisites**

`JUpgrade.properties` and `JUpgrade.key` files store encrypted security information and should be deleted after successful system maintenance.

**Solution**

For SUM SPS07 and lower SUM SPS, the `JUpgrade.properties` and `JUpgrade.key` files must be manually deleted from the following directories:

- **For Windows-based systems:**
  ```
  <DRIVE>:\usr\sap\<SAPSID>\SYS\global\security\data
  ```

- **For UNIX-based systems:**
  ```
  /usr/sap/<SAPSID>/SYS/global/security/data
  ```

As of SUM SPS07 and higher SPS and for all available Upgrade Master DVDs, the `JUpgrade.properties` and `JUpgrade.key` files are automatically removed by the SL Toolset tools at the end of the "PostProcessing" roadmap step.
