### Description

#### Symptom

An authenticated user can use functionality of CRM Survey function module `CRM_SVY_DB_SFA_LIST` to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an Escalation of Privileges.

#### Other Terms

CRM, Survey, SQL Injection, Missing Authorizations, Authorization, Authorization Check

#### Reason and Prerequisites

Function Module `CRM_SVY_DB_SFA_LIST` lacks permission checks for an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functionality. This may result in undesired system behavior.

#### Solution

A new authority check with authorization object `CRM_SVY`, ID `ACTVT`, and FIELD `03` is introduced with this note. You have to check and possibly update the relevant authorization profiles for the affected users that use functionality of CRM Survey.
