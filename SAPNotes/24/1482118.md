**SAP Security Note 1482118 Overview**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 14.06.2011  
**Component:** SAP Business Warehouse > Planning > Business Planning and Simulation (BW-PLA-BPS)  
**Language:** English  
**Master Language:** German  
**Category:** Program error  
**Version:** 8

### **Symptom**
An attacker can change another user without authorization by manipulating data displayed in Business Planning and Simulation (BPS) planning. This can potentially allow access to the victim's authentication data.

### **Impact**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is triggered due to inadequate source code implementation for outputting data via a web page in BPS planning. An attacker can exploit this to manipulate web page contents by crafting a manipulated link. This can lead to stealing logon information from the victim's current session, enabling the attacker to impersonate the victim with the same access rights. If the targeted user has administrative privileges, the entire application data may be compromised.
