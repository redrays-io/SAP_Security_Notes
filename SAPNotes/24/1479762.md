SAP Security Note 1479762 - Missing authority check in SAP_RSADMIN_MAINTAIN

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use functionality of `SAP_RSADMIN_MAINTAIN` to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an escalation of privileges.

**Other Terms**

Authorization, authorization check, SAP_RSADMIN_MAINTAIN, SAP_BW, 'S_TABU_DIS'

**Reason and Prerequisites**

`SAP_RSADMIN_MAINTAIN` lacks permission checks for an authenticated userâ€™s authorization to access some of its functionality. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

An authority check `'S_TABU_DIS'` for the table `RSADMIN` has been added accordingly to the authority checks for customizing transactions. Apply the corresponding note or Support Package.
