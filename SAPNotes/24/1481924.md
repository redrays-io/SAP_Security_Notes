1481924 - Potential remote code execution in RFC lib

**SAP Security Note 1481924 - Potential Remote Code Execution in RFC lib**

**Symptom**

This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see [Security Note 1523254](https://me.sap.com/notes/1523254).

A malicious user can exploit a memory corruption in the RFC library and take complete control of the product, including viewing, changing, or deleting data.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

You are using RFC SDK Versions **6.40**, **7.10**, **7.11**, or **7.20**. In these versions, buffer overflows may occur in the address space of the process due to insufficient checks of interface parameters. Actual attack scenarios are known only for the SAPLogon ActiveX control.

**Solution**

Install a new version of the RFC library on your computer. Versions **7.00** and **7.01** are not susceptible to this problem. For more information, see [Note 1445409](https://me.sap.com/notes/1445409).
