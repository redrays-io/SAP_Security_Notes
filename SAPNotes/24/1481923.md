1481923 - Possible execution of arbitrary commands in RFC SDK tools

**Symptom**

An attacker can exploit a memory corruption in the tools of the RFC SDK on the client to change the program run so that arbitrary commands are executed. As a result, all data of this tool can be seen, deleted, or changed.

**Other Terms**

- Buffer overflow
- Buffer overrun
- Remote code execution

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Sample programs of the RFC SDK on the client exhibit a vulnerability with which a memory overflow can be provoked. An attacker can insert their own commands in the memory area of the process that is running and execute them. It is also possible that only one memory protection violation is triggered, resulting in the program being terminated.

**Solution**

If possible, do not use the sample programs of the RFC SDK. For more information, see [Note 1140031](https://me.sap.com/notes/1140031). The aforementioned problems do not occur with the latest versions of the RFC SDK:

- RFCSDK for 6.40 patch level 50
- RFCSDK for 7.00 patch level 25
- RFCSDK for 7.10 patch level 21
- RFCSDK for 7.11 patch level 8

Although all versions of the RFC SDK are fundamentally compatible, it is recommended to use only the latest release of the RFC SDK, currently from June 2010 (version 7.11). For more information, see [Note 1445409](https://me.sap.com/notes/1445409).
