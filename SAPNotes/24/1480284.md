1480284 - Directory Traversal in ABAP runtime analysis (SE30)

**SAP Security Note 1480284 Overview**

**Symptom:**
This security vulnerability affects the ABAP runtime analysis (SE30) in SAP Basis. An error in SE30 allows a malicious user to perform directory traversal, potentially enabling the writing of arbitrary files on the remote server. This can lead to data corruption or unauthorized alteration of system behavior.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
The ABAP runtime analysis (SE30) does not properly validate the file path for user-submitted files. This oversight allows attackers to overwrite data on the remote system by exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability.
