3000291 - [CVE-2021-21470] XML External Entity vulnerability in SAP EPM add-in

**Symptom**

SAP EPM add-in allows an authenticated attacker with user privileges to parse malicious XML files which could result in XXE-based attacks in applications that accept attacker-controlled XML configuration files. This occurs as the logging service does not disable XML external entities when parsing configuration files and a successful exploit would result in limited impact on the integrity and availability of the application.

**Solution**

The issue is fixed in the notes mentioned in the reference section of this security note. Upgrade your current version of the EPM add-in to SP38 Patch 2 through [2954008](https://me.sap.com/notes/2954008) or Analysis Office to SP6 through [2927196](https://me.sap.com/notes/2927196).
