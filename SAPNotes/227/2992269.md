2992269 - [CVE-2021-21448] Information Disclosure in SAP GUI for Windows

### Description

#### Symptom
SAP GUI for Windows allows an attacker to spoof logon credentials for Application Server ABAP backend systems in the client PC's memory. An exploit can only be executed locally on the client PC and not via the network. The attacker needs at least user authorization of the Operating System user of the victim.

Under certain conditions, *SAP GUI for Windows* allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted.

#### Other Terms
