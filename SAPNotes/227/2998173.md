2998173 - [CVE-2021-21472] Server password not set during installation of SAP NetWeaver Master Data Management 7.1

### Symptom

During the installation of a SAP NetWeaver Master Data Management (MDM) system using Software Provisioning Manager (SWPM), there is no option to set a server password.

### Other Terms

MDS password, MDM password, server password, clix, [CVE-2021-21472](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-21472)

### Reason and Prerequisites

It is recommended to set a password as soon as MDM is installed. The first start-up occurs during the installation with SWPM.

### Solution

During any MDM installation process using SWPM, a password dialog window will be prompted, allowing the user to set an MDM password as soon as MDS is started. The password options are:

- **New**: Create a new password (default)
- **Master**: Use the master password already provided for the SAP system
- **None**: Set the password later (not recommended)

After successfully running the installation, you can proceed to run MDM operations as usual by providing the password you just set when prompted. For more information on MDM operations, refer to [SAP Knowledge Base Article reference 2693178](https://me.sap.com/notes/2693178).
