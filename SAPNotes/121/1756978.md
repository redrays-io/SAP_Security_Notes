**Title**
1756978 - SAML 2.0: possible XML signature wrapping attack

**Description**
### Symptom
Messages sent and received by the SAML 2.0 Service Provider can be manipulated by a malicious user to allow them to perform unauthorised actions on behalf of another user, thereby generally circumventing the integrity protection provided by the service.

### Other Terms
SAML 2.0, SAML2, SAP HANA, XML Signature Wrapping, XSW

### Reason and Prerequisites
The SAML 2.0 Service Provider implementation contains a vulnerability in the manner in which XML signatures are used to certify security assertions. This issue affects multiple vendors of SAML 2.0 implementations, and is not SAP specific. A malicious user can intercept or issue one signed assertion, and use an XML signature wrapping attack to gain higher privileges or impersonate another user. This means that there is a risk of information disclosure, data tampering and system unavailability as a result of this vulnerability.

### Solution
Update your SAP HANA to revision 36 or later.
