**Title:** Unauthorized change of displayed contents in CRM_ITIC

### Description

#### Symptom
By manipulating `CRM_ITIC_ADJ/SESSION_BUFFERED_FRAME.HTM`, an attacker can change displayed data of another user without authorization and may also be able to access their authorization data.

#### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Reflected cross-site scripting can be triggered due to inadequate output coding. As a result, the content of a web page can be manipulated when a manipulated link is called, for example.

An attacker can use reflected cross-site scripting to steal the logon information of the current session of a victim. The attacker can then use this information to impersonate the victim to the server and use the application with the same rights as the compromised user.

If the target of the attack is a user with administrative rights, all of the application data may be compromised as a result.

### Solution
Implement the attached corrections.
