### **Symptom**
The F4 functionality in WEBCUIF and CRMUIF contains code that allows the execution of arbitrary simple Search Help not provided directly by an application through a normal V-Getter. If such a Search Help lacks a built-in authorization mechanism (e.g., a DDIC Search Help), execution is possible, and data is displayed to the originator of the request. However, data cannot be modified. Unauthorized display affects only master data and in limited cases where adding authorization checks within the Search Help is not feasible.

### **Other Terms**
- Search Help Execution
- Unauthorized Display of Data
- Backdoor
- Injection
- F4
- Search Help

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
You are running an application based on the WEB UI Framework: WEBCUIF or CRMUIF. An attacker familiar with the Search Help functionality in these frameworks can invoke an arbitrary DDIC Search Help and display, without authorization, the retrieved data. This leads to the exposure of master data, but the attacker cannot modify or compromise data integrity. A valid and authenticated user is required for this scenario.
