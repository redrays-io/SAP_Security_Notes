**Version:** 5  
**Priority:** HotNews  
**Status:** Released for Customer

### Description

**Symptom:**  
A malicious user can remotely exploit MMR pages and render them unavailable, as well as potentially affect the resources used to serve MMR pages.

**Other Terms:**  
DoS, MMR

### Reason and Prerequisites

**Resource Exhaustion:**  
The issue is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can send specially crafted requests that result in excessive resource consumption. Consequently, other processes cannot allocate new resources, leading to system unavailability. This condition can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

### Solution

To resolve the issue, update the required Software Component Applications (SCAs) on your Java engine. The required SCA versions vary based on your system:

- **SAP NetWeaver 6.40 and BI META MODEL REPOSITORY 3.50:**  
  Update Software Component `BI_MMR.SCA` to at least SP 20.

- **SAP NetWeaver 7.0:**  
  Update Software Component `BI_MMR.SCA` to at least SP 11.

- **SAP NetWeaver CE 7.10:**  
  Update Software Component `MMR_SERVER.SCA` to at least SP1.
