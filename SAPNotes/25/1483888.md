SAP Security Note 1483888 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in MMR

## Overview

SAP Security Note [#1483888](https://me.sap.com/notes/1483888) addresses a critical vulnerability in the Meta Model Repository (MMR) that allows unauthorized modification of displayed application content. This vulnerability poses significant security risks, including the potential theft of authentication information and impersonation of users with elevated privileges.

## Details

### Symptom

Malicious users can exploit the MMR to alter displayed application content without proper authorization. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive authentication information from legitimate users.

### Other Terms

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **MMR (Meta Model Repository)**

### Reason and Prerequisites

The vulnerability arises because pages within the MMR do not adequately encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to non-permanently deface or modify website content. Additionally, XSS can be used to steal authentication data, enabling attackers to impersonate users and potentially compromising the entire application's security, especially if administrative accounts are targeted.

## Solution

The issue has been resolved in the following software versions:

- **SAP NetWeaver 6.40** (formerly known as 2004) and **BI META MODEL REPOSITORY 3.50 - SP 20**, Software Component `BI_MMR.SCA`
- **SAP NetWeaver 7.0** (formerly known as 2004s) - SP 11, Software Component `BI_MMR.SCA`
