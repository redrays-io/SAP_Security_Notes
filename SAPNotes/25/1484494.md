### Title
**1484494 - Security Issue on handling error messages at the front end**

### Description

#### Symptom
The contents of stack trace or error messages result in Java Exceptions, allowing an attacker/hacker to access the stack trace and use this information to exploit a program.

#### Other Terms
Stack Traces, Front end, Catalog 7.01 SP02

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Corporate security issues fixed in this component. The issues were related to detailed error messages.

#### Solution
The solution incorporates security recommendations by logging detailed error messages instead of transferring them to the front end.
1. Use `Category.infoT(Location, String)` instead of `printstacktrace()`.

The solution is provided as part of SRM-MDM-Catalog 7.01 SP02.
