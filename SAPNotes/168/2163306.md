### Description

#### Symptom
You are using client or server components communicating with SAP products with the SSL/TLS protocol enabled or allowed in your configuration, and CommonCryptoLib or SAPCRYPTOLIB is used as SSL/TLS client or server library.

**CVSS Information**  
- **CVSS Base Score**: 5.0 / 10  
- **CVSS Base Vector**:

| Metric                                      | Value       |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| AV : Access Vector (Related exploit range)  | Network (N) |
| AC : Access Complexity (Required attack complexity) | Low (L)     |
| Au : Authentication (Level of authentication needed to exploit) | None (N)    |
| C : Impact to Confidentiality              | None (N)    |
| I : Impact to Integrity                    | Partial (P) |
| A : Impact to Availability                 | None (N)    |

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

#### Other Terms
FREAK, RSA Export Key, CVE-2015-0204, CommonCryptoLib, SAPCRYPTOLIB, SSL, TLS

### Reason and Prerequisites
FREAK (Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys CVE-2015-0204) is a weakness in some implementations of SSL/TLS that may allow an attacker to decrypt secure communications between vulnerable clients and servers.

### Solution
SAP has issued fixes for the following products. Install the fixed product versions most appropriate for your production environment:

- **CommonCryptoLib 8.4.36**, all platforms. This is the recommended library for new systems.
- **SAPCRYPTOLIB 5.5.5 PL39**, all platforms. Use this library if your system is currently running with a SAPCRYPTOLIB 5.5.5.

The following products make use of one of these cryptographic libraries for SSL/TLS:

- NetWeaver AS ABAP, any version
- NetWeaver AS Java, version 7.1x and higher
- SAP HANA XS, any version

There is no need to change the SSL/TLS configurations, but a server restart is recommended.

**Warning**:  
Once the fixed product version is installed, SSL/TLS PSEs with a RSA key-size smaller than 1024-bit will not be supported anymore.
