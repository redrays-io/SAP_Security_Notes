2158791 - Caching KM Content in the Portal

---

**SAP Security Note 2158791: Caching KM Content in the Portal**

**Symptom**

Temporary downloaded files accessed via a browser and stored in Knowledge Management (KM) are not cleared automatically.

For example, when using Internet Explorer to open a document stored in KM, the browser downloads the document to your PC's 'Temporary Internet Files' folder. After closing the document, its content remains in the 'Temporary Internet Files' folder.

**Impact**

This behavior might lead to unauthorized access to a document if the browser's temporary downloaded files are not cleared. By default, the 'Temporary Internet Files' folder of Internet Explorer is a hidden folder under the 'User' directory, accessible only by the user who opened the file. However, this vulnerability might be exploited if the session of the user is active.

**Solution**

1. **Update Support Packages & Patches:**
   Refer to the [Support Packages & Patches](https://me.sap.com/) link to view the versions that include the fix.

2. **Manual Activity Required:**
   Perform the following steps separately on each system into which you transport the Note:

   - Navigate to:
     ```
     System Administration > System Configuration > Knowledge Management > Content Management > Protocols (Advanced Option) > WebDAV protocol
     ```
   - Uncheck the **Force File Caching** attribute to allow browsers to skip file caching and downloading.
