SAP Security Note 2160790: Missing authorization check in FS-CML

**Overview**
  
SAP Security Note **2160790** addresses a critical issue in the **FS-CML** component where an authorization check is missing. This vulnerability allows authenticated users to access restricted functions, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Symptom**
