2159601 - SAP Mobile Platform XXE (add repository)

**Symptom**

A maliciously crafted XML document could exploit a misconfigured XML parser for processing EclipseLink p2 repository operations, possibly resulting in data disclosure or denial of service problems.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 5.5 / 10
- **Vector:** `AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P`

| Metric                     | Value       |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Attack Vector**          | Network (N) |
| **Attack Complexity**      | Low (L)     |
| **Authentication**         | Single (S)  |
| **Confidentiality Impact** | Partial (P) |
| **Integrity Impact**       | None (N)    |
| **Availability Impact**    | Partial (P) |

**Other Terms**

- XXE
- Data disclosure
- Denial of service

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The XML Parser and its settings are inherited from the EclipseLink component, which is part of the OSGi administration under the SMP server. The parser settings have been updated to prevent vulnerability to XXE attacks.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs an authenticated session to SMP as an Administrator. This can be achieved by knowing the SMP Administrator's username and password or by stealing the session cookie of an authenticated administrator.

**Solution**

Apply patch **SMP 3.0 SP07 PL01** to your SMP server installation.
