2165583 - SAP HANA Secure Configuration of Internal Communication

**Symptom**
  
SAP HANA internal services could be accessed without authentication if the HANA system is insecurely configured and no other security measures are in place. This could endanger system availability, data confidentiality, and integrity.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.6 / 10
- **CVSS Base Vector:**
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
  - **Access Complexity (AC):** High (H)
  - **Authentication (Au):** None (N)
  - **Impact to Confidentiality (C):** Partial (P)
  - **Impact to Integrity (I):** Partial (P)
  - **Impact to Availability (A):** Complete (C)

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

**Other Terms**

HANA, encryption, network, hostname, listeninterface, TrexNet

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The internal SAP HANA services communication can be attacked if:

1. The HANA system is not located behind a firewall that blocks access to HANA internal communication channels.
2. SSL/TLS with mutual host authentication is not enabled for distributed HANA systems or HANA system replication.
3. The configuration of the internal HANA network is incorrect.

**Solution**

Follow the recommendations to configure HANA internal service communication in:

- **HANA Master Guide:** Chapter "SAP HANA Architecture"
- **SAP HANA Security Guide:** Chapter "SAP HANA Network and Communication Security"
- **SAP HANA Security Guide:** Chapter "Security Configuration Checklist" → "Network"

The referred documentation can be found under [SAP HANA Platform Documentation](http://help.sap.com/hana_platform).

Check the internal network configuration of SAP HANA and correct the settings if necessary. To check the configuration of your HANA system, please follow the instructions in [SAP Note 2183363](https://me.sap.com/notes/2183363).
