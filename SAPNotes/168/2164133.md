### Description

#### Symptom
- An attacker can remotely exploit IGS to manually terminate it.
- Exploiting IGS can render it and its associated resources unavailable.
- Full control of the product can be achieved by an attacker, including viewing, changing, or deleting data.

#### Other Terms

#### Reason and Prerequisites
- **Memory Corruption:** Causes the process to terminate by provoking a condition where the process reads outside its memory space, leading to a memory protection fault.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Launching specially crafted requests can consume excessive resources, preventing other processes from allocating new resources and causing system unavailability.
- **Buffer Overflow:** Allows attackers to inject and execute code within the application's working memory or cause the application to terminate.

### Solution
Download and install the IGS patch level 10 or higher.
