2155978 - Potential disclosure of persisted data in Greek FI localization

**SAP Note Number:** 2155978  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 05.08.2015

### Description

**Symptom**  
An attacker can use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, resulting in the retrieval of additional information persisted by the system.

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by an attacker. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to retrieve data from the database.

**Solution**  
As a general rule, SAP recommends that you install a solution by applying a Support Package. However, if you need to install a solution earlier, use the Note Assistant to implement the correction instruction.

You can find more information about the Note Assistant in [SAP Service Marketplace](https://me.sap.com/service.sap.com/note-assistant).
