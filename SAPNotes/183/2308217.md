SAP Security Note 2308217 - Missing XML Validation vulnerability in Web-Survey

**Description**

**Symptom**
Web Survey does not sufficiently validate an XML document accepted from an untrusted source. This Missing XML Validation vulnerability can lead to:

- Arbitrary file retrieval from the server
- Denial-of-service conditions in successful exploits

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 7.5 / 10
- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)
- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)
- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)
- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** None (N)
- **Integrity Impact (I):** None (N)
- **Availability Impact (A):** High (H)

*Note:* This CVSS v3 score is an estimate of the risk posed by the issue and does not account for specific system configurations or operational environments. It is advised to conduct a thorough risk assessment to determine the applicability and priority of this security note. More information can be found in the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://me.sap.com/support/securitynotes).

**Reason and Prerequisites**
A program error allows the set of valid entities in Web Survey XML for Incoming Mail-Replies to be extended by defining new external entities. Unless configured otherwise, external entities can force the XML parser to access resources specified by URIs, exposing the application to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. These attacks can be used to perform denial of service on the local system, gain unauthorized access to files on the local machine, scan remote machines, and perform denial of service on remote systems.

**Solution**
The XML parser has been securely configured to prevent the allowance of external entities in incoming XML documents within Web Survey. Implement the attached correction instructions corresponding to your release to mitigate this vulnerability.
