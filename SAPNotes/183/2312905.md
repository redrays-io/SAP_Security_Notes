SAP Security Note 2312905 â€“ Denial of Service (DOS) in SAPCAR

**Symptom**

An attacker can exploit SAPCAR to potentially terminate the process.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 3.4 / 10
- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L)
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
- **Privileges Required (PR):** High (H)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The issue is caused by an invalid file handle access that causes the SAPCAR process to terminate or crash. Using a specially crafted SAPCAR archive, an attacker can provoke a condition where the SAPCAR process attempts to write to a file using an invalid file handle. As a result, the system terminates the process, rendering the application unusable until it is restarted manually.
