### Description

**Symptom**  
AS Java Web Container does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a content spoofing vulnerability when error pages are displayed.

**Other Terms**  
Content Spoofing, XSS

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
Content spoofing is an attack technique used to trick a user into believing that certain content appearing on a website is legitimate and not from an external source. This attack is typically used as, or in conjunction with, social engineering because it exploits a code-based vulnerability and a user's trust.

### Solution
