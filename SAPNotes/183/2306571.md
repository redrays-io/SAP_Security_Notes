2306571 - Denial of Service (DOS) in SAP Data Services

**Symptom**
SAP Data Services allows an attacker to prevent legitimate users from accessing Metadata Service from Workbench by sending a crafted packet. This causes service disruptions during the development of data services jobs.

**Impact**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** vulnerabilities can lead to:
  - Long response delays and service interruptions, degrading the service quality experienced by legitimate users.
  - Direct impact on availability.

- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 7.5 / 10
- **CVSS v3 Vector:** 
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
  - **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
  - **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)
  - **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)
  - **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)
  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** None (N)

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The service interruption occurs only during the development of data services jobs using the Workbench component. Jobs promoted to QA or production environments never use Metadata Service.

**Solution**
1. The service interruption is now prevented by implementing input validation for the message sequence and closing the socket connections of rogue clients.
2. Implement the specified Support Packages and Patches as detailed in the SAP Note.
