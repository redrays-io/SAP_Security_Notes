2308778 - Denial of service (DOS) in Sybase SQL Anywhere MobiLink Synchronization Server

**Description**

**Symptom**

Attackers could have crashed the MobiLink server, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.

Some well-known impacts of a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability are:

- Long response delays and service interruptions, thus degrading the service quality experienced by legitimate users
- Direct impact on availability

- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 4.9 / 10
- **CVSS v3 Vector:**
  - **AV:** Network (N)
  - **AC:** Low (L)
  - **PR:** High (H)

**Other Terms**

DoS, DDoS, Distributed Denial of Service, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, Resource Exhaustion

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The crash occurred if a monitoring request authenticated twice. Since the monitoring request was authenticating twice, it was being added twice, and the duplicate was not handled correctly.

**Solution**

Fixed by Engineering Case #795422:

- **SQL Anywhere 17.0.0** build 1411 (PL 6 or higher)
- **SQL Anywhere 16.0.0** build 2244 (SP 53 or higher)
- **SQL Anywhere 12.0.1** build 4380 (SP 102 or higher)

Duplicate requests now fail and are not added to the list.

*Note that this is a weak attack since the attacker must successfully authenticate before the crash can occur.*

**Affected Components**

- **Component:** Basis Components > Sybase Products > SQL Anywhere (on premise, on demand) > SQL Anywhere - MobiLink (BC-SYB-SQA-ML)
