**SAP Security Note 887164: BSP Test Applications in Production Systems**

**Overview**
SAP Security Note [887164](https://me.sap.com/notes/887164) addresses a critical security issue related to Business Server Pages (BSP) test applications in production environments. These applications are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to insufficient input validation and output encoding.

**Symptom**
XSS attacks can occur when malicious HTML and JavaScript are injected into form fields and echoed back to the browser. This vulnerability arises because the BSP applications do not validate all input and fail to HTML encode output before sending it to the browser.

**Affected Systems**
This security note is relevant for the following SAP_BASIS versions:
- From 610 to 640
- 700
- 710

**Recommendation**
To mitigate the risk of XSS attacks, it is strongly recommended to disable all unnecessary BSP test applications in production systems. Specifically, the following ICF nodes should be deactivated using transaction SICF:

- SBSPEXT_HTMLB
- SBSPEXT_XHTMLB
- SBSPEXT_PHTMLB
- SBSPEXT_TABLE
- HTMLB_SAMPLES
- BSP_MODEL
- ITMVC2
- IT00
- IT01
- IT02
- IT03
- IT04
- IT05
- ITSM
- SYSTEM_PUBLIC
- SYSTEM_PRIVATE

Disabling these nodes helps secure your production environment by removing unused and potentially vulnerable applications.

**Upcoming Improvements**
Future Support Packages will include HTML encoding enhancements for these test applications:
- 620SP57
- 640SP15
- 700SP06

**Action Steps**
1. Access transaction SICF in your SAP system.
2. Navigate to the ICF nodes listed above.
3. Deactivate each unnecessary BSP test application.
