SAP Security Note 883908 - ITS620: check global service in URL

**Description**
---
ITS 6.20 allows disabling services using the ITS admin tool. When a service is disabled, it cannot be accessed by users. However, there's an issue with disabling the technical service **global**. This service is typically non-callable and only serves to provide global information inherited by other services. If a user attempts to access the URL `http://host.domain:port/scripts/wgate/global/!`, the logon page appears. While this might be an unwanted behavior for customers who disable all unused services, it doesn't pose a significant security risk as an attacker cannot perform more actions than what is possible on any ITS logon page.

**Solution**
---
With **ITS 6.20 patch 20**, the ability to call the **global** service is blocked, resolving the issue described above.
