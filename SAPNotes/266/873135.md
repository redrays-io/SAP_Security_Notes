**Type:** SAP Security Note

**Recency:** New

**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 12.04.2011  
**Component:** Cross-Application Components > General Application Functions > Schedule Manager

### Description

**Symptom**

Certain functions of the Schedule Manager monitor can be called even though the user who is logged on does not have the required authorization for this. This can potentially result in an Escalation of Privileges.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Authorization checks are missing in the Schedule Manager monitor to regulate access to the functions. Without these checks, a user who is logged on can simply call these functions; this may result in an undesired change in the system behavior.

**Solution**

Implement the program corrections described below.
