#### General Notes for Oracle Critical Patch Updates (CPU)

- **May 2010:** Explicit CPU patches will no longer be provided for UNIX platforms. Future CPU patches will be contained in Patch Set Updates (PSUs) available every four months within an SAP Bundle Patch (SBP).
- **Since 2005:** Oracle provides quarterly CPUs containing corrections for significant security issues. These must be installed unless they conflict with other mandatory SAP patches.
- **Release 10.2.0.4:** CPU patches now follow the "n-apply" procedure, containing only security patches without functional patches. Patch molecules can be installed independently, reducing the likelihood of conflicts. 

**Note:** Installation of CPU patches using MOPatch (Note 1027012) is not supported.

### Reason and Prerequisites

Critical Patch Updates contain corrections for moderately severe and very severe security issues, including:

- Prerequisites for the security patch
- Patches requested by many clients
- Patches that may already be implemented and could cause conflicts
