SAP Security Note 1508412 - Code Injection Vulnerability in Condition Technique

**SAP Security Note 1508412** addresses a critical vulnerability in the condition technique of the SAP Application Platform (AP-PRC-CON). This vulnerability allows malicious users to execute arbitrary program code, potentially leading to system behavior manipulation or privilege escalation without legitimate credentials.

### Symptom
Condition technique contains code that allows the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice. A malicious user can control the system's behavior or escalate privileges by executing malicious code without legitimate credentials.

### Other Terms
- Backdoor
- Injection
- Run
- Credentials
- Condition Technique

### Reason and Prerequisites
The program code allows defining and executing user-supplied code, altering system behavior. No valid or authenticated user is required. Depending on the injected code, attackers can:
- Inject and run their own code
- Obtain unauthorized information
- Modify or delete data
- Alter system output
- Create users with higher privileges
- Perform denial of service attacks

### Solution
Apply the attached correction instructions provided in the SAP Security Note. Ensure that **Manual Preimplementation Steps** are also performed as outlined in the instructions.
