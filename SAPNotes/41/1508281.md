**Symptom**  
A malicious user can trigger functionality in BC-SRV-RM without authentication and authorization.  
This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see [Security Note 1557613](https://me.sap.com/notes/1557613).

**Other Terms**  
Cross Site Request Forgery, BC-SRV-RM, BC-SRV-CM, XSRF

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
BC-SRV-RM executes certain functions through referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the user.

If present, the attacker may use a Cross Site Scripting attack to trigger the exploit, or use an approach in which a link to click is presented to the victim.

**Solution**  
Implement the correction instructions or import the relevant Support Package.
