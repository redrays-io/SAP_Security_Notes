### Title
1491683 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content - Vendor Eval

### Description

**Symptom**  
The SRM BI Content BSP Application `SRM_VE_SERVICE` could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**  
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SRM BI, SRM BI Security, Vendor Evaluation, SRM VE, SRM BSP Application, SRM_VE_SERVICE

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
Pages within the BSP Application `SRM_VE_SERVICE` do not sufficiently encode INPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data could use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the application's security could be fully compromised.
