### Symptom
The applet `ws.jar` (used for the frontend services in ITS) runs not in the context of the ITS but in an external page. It is still possible that the frontend service is executed.

### Other Terms
SAP ITS; SAP integrated ITS; internal ITS; webgui; SAP GUI for HTML.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Use of the applet on a page not created by the ITS.

### Solution
The frontend service action is now disabled if the applet does not run in the context of the ITS. Entry "communication error with sapsystem" will be written into the Java console.
