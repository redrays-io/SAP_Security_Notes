SAP Security Note 1491966 - Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in CRM-BPS

**Symptom**
The CRM sales planning in BW-BPS could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting, XSS, Sales Planning UI

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Pages within the sales planning of BW-BPS do not sufficiently encode parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a web site.
Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user’s authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data could use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the application’s security could be fully compromised.

**Solution**
We recommend applying the corresponding [support package](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKW70025) for your SAP_BW component. Alternatively, you can implement the [corrective instructions](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001491966/654).
