SAP Security Note 1491867: Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Broadcasting Content

**Symptom**

This security note addresses an issue where the broadcasting component in SAP can be abused by a malicious user. An attacker could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Issue**

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack can be utilized to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a web site. This vulnerability allows attackers to steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. With this information, an attacker could impersonate the user and access all information and functionalities available to that user. If an administrator's credentials are compromised, it could lead to a complete security breach of the application.

**Impact**

- Unauthorized modification of broadcasting content.
- Potential theft of user authentication information.
- Risk of impersonating users, including administrators, leading to full compromise of the application's security.

**Solution**

All customizing data are now escaped by the API, ensuring that malicious JavaScript code in the customizing table will not be executed. It is crucial to apply the attached correction instructions provided in the security note.
