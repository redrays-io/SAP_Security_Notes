**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Release Status:** Released for Customer

**Title:** Unauthorized modification of stored content in Portal Masthead

### Description

#### Symptom

The Welcome String in the Portal Masthead can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**  
- **CVSS Base Score:** 2.1  
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/AU:S/C:N/I:P/A:N  

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

#### Other Terms

Stored cross-site scripting, XSS, Masthead, Welcome String

#### Reason and Prerequisites

The welcome string in the Portal Masthead results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the attacker to embed content that is rendered automatically without targeting victims individually.

Stored XSS can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
