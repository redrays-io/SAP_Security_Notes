1993349 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in SAP HANA XS Administration Tool

**Symptom**

The SAP HANA XS Administration Tool can be exploited by an attacker to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability may also allow the attacker to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 4.3
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

**Other Terms**

Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), SAP HANA XS Administration Tool

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Functions within the SAP HANA XS Administration Tool do not sufficiently encode or filter output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a website. Additionally, the attacker may steal user authentication information, potentially allowing impersonation of users and compromising application security.

**Solution**

This issue is resolved in:
- **SAP HANA Revision 72** (for SPS07)
- **SAP HANA Revision 69 Patch Level 04** (for SPS06)

It is recommended to update to these or later revisions to mitigate the vulnerability.
