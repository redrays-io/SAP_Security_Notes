1988565 - Switchable Authorization Checks for RFC in IS-B-BCA

## Description

### Symptom
This SAP note describes new switchable authorization checks for RFC function modules in IS-B-BCA.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Remote calls to RFC function modules are protected by checks on the authorization object `S_RFC`. Authorizations for `S_RFC` must be limited to the required minimum authorizations for all users to ensure system security. Many RFC function modules can be sufficiently protected using `S_RFC` authorization checks. These RFC function modules often do not perform additional functional authorization checks. Please see [SAP Note 2008727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2008727) for further information on RFC Security.

It was identified that `S_RFC` authorization checks might not be sufficient to ensure secure execution for RFC function modules covered by this note. Activate new switchable authorization checks and update corresponding roles if these RFC function modules are included in `S_RFC` authorizations in your system.

### Solution
New switchable authorization checks have been implemented. The checks are delivered inactive to ensure compatibility with your running processes. The checks can be activated in transaction SACF as described in the attached manual correction instructions.

#### New Authorization Scenario
**BKK_MISC** - *BKK: Miscellaneous Authority Checks in RFC Enabled Function Modules*

This scenario includes the following authorization objects that might be checked if one of the function modules listed below are called by a customer application via external RFC, provided they are applicable:

- `F_BKKA_ATT`
- `F_BKKA_BKA`
- `F_BKKA_BPG`
- `F_BKKA_GRP`
- `F_BKKA_PRG`
- `F_PROD_GRP`
- `S_TABU_DIS`

#### Affected Business Processes, Integration Scenarios, and Users
This scenario might be relevant to integration scenarios developed by customers which involve one of the function modules listed below.

#### Implementation of the Switchable Authorization Check
The switchable authorization scenario is provided via support package. It can also be pre-implemented via the correction instructions in systems with older support packages.

#### Activation of the Authorization Check
Follow the post-processing activities below to activate the authorization scenario.

**Affected RFC Function Modules:**
- `BKK_PRODUCT_CHECK_FUNCTION`
- `BKK_RFC_BANKACCT_BKKRS_COMCODE`
- `BKK_RFC_PROFIT_AND_LOSS_GET`
- `BKK_RFC_COND_GET_BKK9ACC` (no longer RFC enabled)
- `BKK_RFC_COND_GET_BKK9ACC_ACC` (no longer RFC enabled)

### Correction Instructions
1. **Manual Pre-Implement:**
   - **Software Component:** EA-FINSERV
   - **Release:** 600 to 617
   - Execute the manual activities as specified in the note to create necessary data elements and message classes.

2. **Activate the Authorization Check:**
   - Create the authorization scenario definition in older support packages using transaction SACF_TRANSFER.
   - Transfer the scenario definition to a productive scenario in transaction SACF.
   - Activate logging of SACF relevant audit messages in the Security Audit Log via transaction SM19.

For detailed step-by-step instructions, refer to the [Correction Instructions Attachment](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001988565/attachment) (replace with actual link if available).

### Support Package
Ensure that the relevant support packages are applied to your system. Refer to the [Support Package Details](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKGPFD28) for more information.

### Validity
This note is applicable to the following software components and versions:
- **EA-FINSERV:** 600 to 617
- **SAP_BASIS:** Various releases as specified in the note
