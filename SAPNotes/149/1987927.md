1987927 - Security risk with logout feature in standalone POD

## Description

**Symptom**
>This issue occurs when the Production Operator Dashboard (POD) is accessed via a standalone URL. After logging out by clicking the logout link, the user session might sometimes remain active. This allows the next user utilizing the same PC to open the POD with the credentials of the first user without needing to log in again. Clicking the logout link twice will always terminate the session properly.

**CVSS Information**
- **Base Score:** 4.6
- **Vector:** AV:L/AC:L/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

**Solution**
Code corrections have been implemented within the WPMF framework to ensure that the logout process is executed every time the logout icon is clicked in the POD. 

**Availability**
The solution is available in **SAP ME 6.1 SP04 Patch 10** or higher releases.
