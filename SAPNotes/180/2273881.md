2273881 - Update 1 to Security Note 2234226

**SAP Security Note 2273881** addresses a critical vulnerability related to TREX/BWA components. Below are the key details:

### Symptom
This SAP Note supplements the solution provided in security note 2234226. An attacker could execute remote commands on the host where TREX/BWA is running with SIDadm user's rights, potentially compromising the host OS or obtaining technical information without authentication.

### CVSS Information
- **Base Score:** 7.5 / 10
- **Vector:**
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
  - **Access Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
  - **Authentication (Au):** None (N)
  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** Partial (P)
  - **Integrity Impact (I):** Partial (P)
  - **Availability Impact (A):** Partial (P)

*Note:* This CVSS base score estimates the risk posed by the issue and does not account for specific system configurations. Conduct your own risk assessments to determine applicability and priority.

### Reason and Prerequisites
An internal interface in TREX/BWA allows executing OS commands using SIDadm rights without authentication. While Security Note 2234226 mitigates some risks, it cannot prevent all instances of host OS compromise or technical information disclosure, especially if TREX is not in an isolated subnet.

### Solution
Upgrade to the following versions to implement the necessary access controls:
- **TREX:** Version 7.10 Revision 67 or 7.25 SP034
- **BWA:** Version 7.00 Revision 73 or 7.20 SP036

These upgrades include access controls that prevent unauthorized processes from using the internal interface, based on the current landscape configuration.

### Validity
Applicable to:
- **TREX:** 7.10, 7.25
- **BIA:** 7.00, 7.20
