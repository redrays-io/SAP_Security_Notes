2271802 - Switchable authorization checks for RFC in External List Management (CRM-MKT-EAL)

```markdown
**SAP Security Note 2271802** introduces new switchable authorization checks for RFC (Remote Function Call) function modules in External List Management (CRM-MKT-EAL). This enhancement aims to provide more granular control over authorization objects, ensuring tighter security and compliance within your SAP environment.

### **Symptom**
Remote calls to RFC function modules were previously protected by checks on the authorization object `S_RFC`. However, it was identified that these checks might not be sufficient to ensure secure execution for certain RFC function modules within External List Management.

### **Solution**
The SAP Note implements new switchable authorization checks that can be activated as needed. These checks are delivered inactive by default to maintain compatibility with existing processes. Here's how to implement and activate the new authorization checks:

#### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Download the SAP Note:**
   - [Download for SNOTE](https://me.sap.com/note/0040000013438302017)
   - [PDF Version](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sfm/notes/print/0002271802?language=en-US&token=85286965583E1354E28B4FA61C3403B2)

2. **Activate the Authorization Checks:**
   - **Step 1:** Create the authorization scenario definition in your landscape.
     - Use transaction `SACF` to check for the existence of `CRM_MKT_EAL_1`.
     - If not present, download the `CRM_MKT_EAL_1.TXT` attachment and upload it via transaction `SACF_TRANSFER`.
     - Assign the scenario definition to the development package `CRM_MKTLIST_ADMIN`.
   
   - **Step 2:** Create the productive authorization scenario.
     - In transaction `SACF`, select the scenario definition and transfer it to a productive scenario.
     - Choose the initial scenario status (`Active` or `Logging`).
   
   - **Step 3:** Activate logging of SACF relevant audit messages in the Security Audit Log.
     - Ensure Security Audit Log is active in transaction `SM19`.
     - Activate message IDs `DUO`, `DUP`, and `DUQ`.
   
   - **Step 4:** Adjust roles to provide necessary authorizations.
     - Use report `RSAU_SELECT_EVENTS` to identify users needing authorization adjustments.
     - Analyze audit messages `DUO` and `DUP`.
   
   - **Step 5:** Maintain RFC Function Modules default values.
     - In transaction `SU22`, check and add the authorization object `CRM_LIST_H` with default value `(ACTVT=02)` if it doesn't exist.
