SAP Security Note 2266967: Switchable Authorization Checks for RFC in CRM-MW-MON

---

**Description**

This SAP Security Note introduces new switchable authorization checks for RFC function modules in CRM-MW-MON. These additional checks enhance security by providing more granular control over authorizations beyond the standard S_RFC object.

**Symptom**

Remote Function Calls (RFC) to certain function modules may not have sufficient authorization checks, potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions within the CRM-MW-MON component.

**Solution**

Implement the new switchable authorization checks as outlined in the note. The steps include:

1. **Apply Correction Instructions**
   - Use Transaction SNOTE to apply the correction instructions provided in SAP Note 2266967.
   - Alternatively, download and apply the correction instructions manually from the attachment.

2. **Activate Authorization Checks**
   - Navigate to Transaction SACF.
   - Check if the scenario definition `CRM_MW_GAS` exists. If not, download and upload the `CRM_MW_GAS.TXT` file from the attachments.
   - Create a productive authorization scenario from the scenario definition.
   - Choose the appropriate scenario status (`Active` or `Logging`) to activate the checks.

3. **Update User Roles**
   - After activation, review and update user roles to include the necessary authorizations based on the new checks.
   - Use reports like `RSAU_SELECT_EVENTS` to identify users requiring additional authorizations.
