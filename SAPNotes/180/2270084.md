SAP Security Note 2270084: Switchable Authorization Checks for RFC in CRM-MW-MFW

**Title:**  
2270084 - Switchable authorization checks for RFC in CRM-MW-MFW

**Description:**  
This SAP security note introduces new switchable authorization checks for RFC function modules in the CRM-MW-MFW component. The enhancement ensures that remote calls to RFC function modules are securely protected by additional authorization checks beyond the standard S_RFC object.

**Symptom:**  
Existing S_RFC authorization checks may not be sufficient to ensure secure execution for certain RFC function modules in CRM-MW-MFW. This can potentially lead to unauthorized data migrations or processing if not properly managed.

**Solution:**  
The note provides new switchable authorization checks that are initially inactive to maintain compatibility with current processes. Administrators can activate these checks via the SACF transaction. The activation involves:

1. **Implementing the Switchable Authorization Checks:**
   - Execute the correction instructions provided in the support package.
   
2. **Activating the Authorization Checks:**
   - Use transaction SACF to create a productive authorization scenario from the scenario definition.
   - Choose between "Active" or "Logging" statuses depending on your monitoring needs.
   
3. **Adjusting User Roles:**
   - Identify and grant necessary authorizations to users based on the new authorization scenario using reports like RSAU_SELECT_EVENTS.

**Affected Business Processes and Roles:**  
Data processing in BDOCs may be impacted if authorization checks fail. Proper roles must be assigned to ensure authorized data migration and processing.

**Affected RFC Function Modules:**  
- **Function Module:** CMW_TRANSFERIN_PROCESS  
  **Authorization Object:** CRM_MW_FC  
  **Parameter:** ACTVT = 16

**Support Packages:**  
Ensure that your system is updated with the relevant support packages for your CRM-MW-MFW component.

**Prerequisites:**  
- Installed support packages as specified in the note.
- Existing authorization scenario definitions in SACF.

**Manual Activities:**  
Activation of the authorization checks requires manual steps in transaction SACF and adjustments to user roles. Detailed instructions are provided within the note.
