2272211 - Update of SAPUI5 version in SAP HANA due to security note 2204160

**SAP Security Note 2272211** addresses a critical security vulnerability in SAPUI5 used within SAP HANA Extended Application Services classic model. This update is essential to protect your systems from potential attacks that exploit this vulnerability.

### Symptom
SAP HANA includes SAPUI5 for applications based on the SAP HANA Extended Application Services classic model. A vulnerability in SAPUI5 allows attackers to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from legitimate users.

### CVSS Information
- **Base Score:** 4.3 / 10
- **Vector:** 
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
  - **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium (M)
  - **Authentication (Au):** None (N)
  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** None (N)
  - **Integrity Impact (I):** Partial (P)
  - **Availability Impact (A):** None (N)

**Note:** This CVSS score is an estimate of the risk and does not account for your specific system configuration or environment. Conduct your own risk assessment to determine the applicability and priority of this security note.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The Support Tool within SAPUI5 does not sufficiently encode input parameters, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This can allow attackers to:
- Deface or modify displayed content on your web applications.
- Steal authentication information from users, potentially allowing attackers to impersonate users with the same access rights.
