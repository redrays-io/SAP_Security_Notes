SAP Security Note 2728839 - Missing Authorization check in ABAP Platform

**Description**

Customizing functionality of ABAP Platform does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in escalation of privileges.

**Symptom**

- Abuse functionality restricted to a particular user group
- Read, modify, or delete restricted data

**Solution**

By this correction, an authorization check `T_CODE` with the value `"SPRO"` is introduced for the entry point used by other transactions, such as from the transport organizer.
