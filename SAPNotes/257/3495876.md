3495876 - [Multiple CVEs] Multiple vulnerabilities in SAP Replication Server (FOSS)

**SAP Security Note 3495876 Overview**

### Symptom
SAP Replication Server includes Free Open Source Software (FOSS) libraries OpenSSL and Spring Framework that have been identified with multiple vulnerabilities:

- [CVE-2023-0215](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0215)
- [CVE-2022-0778](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0778)
- [CVE-2023-0286](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0286)

While SAP Replication Server itself is not directly impacted by these vulnerabilities, the installation environment could be exploitable due to the presence of these vulnerable libraries.

### Affected Versions
The following product versions include the vulnerable libraries:

- SAP Replication Server 16.0 SP04 PL06
- SAP Replication Server 16.0 SP03 PL15

### Solution
Upgrade the vulnerable libraries to the fixed versions:

- **OpenSSL:** Upgrade to version **1.1.1w**
- **Spring Framework:** Upgrade to version **5.3.31**

This can be achieved by installing the updated SAP Replication Server versions:

- SAP Replication Server 16.0 SP04 PL06
- SAP Replication Server 16.0 SP03 PL15

**Important:** The installer does not remove the older versions of the libraries. You must manually delete the following after the upgrade:

- **Folder:** `$SYBASE/REP-16_0/lib3p64/openssl` (redundant folder)
- **Files:** `$SYBASE/RMA-16_0/libs/spring/spring-*.jar` (versions below 5.3.31)
- **File:** `$SYBASE/REP-16_0/ASA17/OCS/OCS-16_0/bin/openssl` (if upgraded to SAP Replication Server 16.0 SP04 PL06)

### CVSS Score
- **Score:** 6.5
- **Vector:** [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)
