2368082 - Information Disclosure in ABAP Development Environment

### Description

#### Symptom
Under certain conditions, the ABAP Development Environment allows an attacker to access information that would otherwise be restricted.

Some well-known impacts of Information Disclosure are:
- Loss of information and system configuration confidentiality
- Information gathering for further exploits and attacks

#### Other Terms
- Information Exposure
- Information Leak
- User-Specific Settings

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Via user-specific settings, various tools within the ABAP Development Environment can be accessed. This enables a malicious user to get to know about development objects not accessible otherwise. Note that the object details are not accessible if the appropriate authorization is missing.

### Solution
The solution isolates some of the tools from each other. For example, if the text editor (transaction SE61) is configured, access to other developer tools is not possible anymore.
