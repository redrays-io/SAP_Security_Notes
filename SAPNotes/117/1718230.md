**Title**
1718230 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in StratBuild

**Description**

### Symptom
Strategy Builder can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, Strategy Builder

### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within Strategy Builder do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution
The fix is provided within the following patches and SPs:
- XI3.1 SP3 patch 8
- XI3.1 SP4 patch 3
- XI3.1 SP5 patch 1
- XI3.1 SP6

The issue does not exist in XI4.0.
