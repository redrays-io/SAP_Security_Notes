- **Released On:** September 11, 2012

## Symptom

Implementing **Security Note 1531958** in CRM 5.0 results in the SwingUI PME failing with the following error message:

```
Open database error: INTERNAL_ERROR
```

This issue occurs because the Swing UI PME loses access to the function module `EXTRACT_DATA`, preventing it from accessing necessary database functions.

## Solution

To resolve this issue and restore access to the `EXTRACT_DATA` function module in Swing UI PME within CRM 5.0, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Customer-Specific Implementation:**
   - Implement the interface `IF_EX_EXTRACT_DATA`.

2. **Implement the `CHECK_TABLE_ACCESS` Method:**
   - Customize the method to fit your authorization requirements.

3. **Enhancement and BAdI Implementation:**
   - Provide an implementation to the Enhancement Spot `EXTRACT_DATA`.
   - Use the BAdI Definition `EXTRACT_DATA` and assign your custom class as the implementation.

4. **Enable Table Access:**
   - Grant access to tables starting with `COMM_CFG`, `/1SAP1/SE`, and `T00`.
   - If additional tables are required, include them in your BAdI implementation.
