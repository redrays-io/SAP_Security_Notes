**SAP Security Note 1718613: Missing authorization check in FM DD_DB_IMIG_CALL_INSTTOOL**

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functions of IMIG to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.6
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).*

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The function module `DD_DB_IMIG_CALL_INSTTOOL` does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This omission may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**
1. **Check for the Module:**
   Verify whether the module `DD_DB_IMIG_CALL_INSTTOOL` exists in your system.
   
2. **Import Transport Request:**
   If the module is present, import the attached transport request [BIOK018090.SAR](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012003146900000264962012&iv_version=0007&iv_guid=8C65C9247BEBDD4D801CB3DBAC81141D). This action will delete the module from your system. **Note:** Transaction IMIG will no longer function correctly after this import.

3. **Handle Syntax Errors:**
   The function group SDBM will display syntax errors post-import. These can be ignored. If necessary, finalize the deletion of the module within the group by:
   - Navigating to transaction SE37.
   - Using the menu item **Utilities > Repair Function Group**.
   - Entering **SDBM** and following the prompts to complete the deletion.
   - Editing the function module `DD_DB_IMIG_PREP_FILES` to add the specified lines, then activating the changes to ensure no syntax errors remain.

4. **Transport to Other Systems:**
   - The transport can be added to the import queues of Quality and Production systems.
   - Alternatively, import it to a development system first, then add the function group SDBM to a workbench request and release it to your transport landscape.
