### **Description**

#### **Symptom**
Loans Management does not execute the required authorization checks for an authenticated user, which may result in an escalation of privileges.

The known effects of the missing authorization check include:
- Fraudulent or incorrect use of functions that should be restricted to certain user groups.
- Ability to read, modify, or delete data to which access should be restricted.

#### **Reason and Prerequisites**
Loans Management lacks authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's permissions to access certain functions. This absence can lead to undesired system behavior.

#### **Solution**
New authorization checks have been implemented to ensure that users have the appropriate permissions before accessing sensitive functions within Loans Management.
