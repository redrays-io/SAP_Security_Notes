### Description

#### Symptom
An attacker can manipulate data of another user, which is displayed by input fields or URL paths without authorization. This may allow access to the authentication data of the affected user.

#### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The JavaServer Pages (JSPs) in the administration of the XML Data Archiving Services (XML DAS) lack sufficient input validation and output encoding. This vulnerability allows reflected cross-site scripting attacks, enabling an attacker to manipulate the content of a web page through a crafted link.

An attacker can exploit this to steal the logon information of the victim's current session. With this information, the attacker can impersonate the victim and access the application with the same privileges. If the victim has administrative rights, the attacker could compromise all application data.

#### Solution
Implement comprehensive input validation and output encoding in the JSPs within the administration of the XML Data Archiving Services (XML DAS) to eliminate the vulnerability.
