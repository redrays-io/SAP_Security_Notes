SAP Security Note 3341599 - [CVE-2023-36923] Code Injection Vulnerability in SAP PowerDesigner

**Description**

**Symptom**
SAP SQLA for PowerDesigner 17 bundled with SAP PowerDesigner 16.7 SP06 PL03 allows an attacker with local access to place a malicious library that can be executed by the application. An attacker could thereby control the behavior of the application.

**Other Terms**
- Command Injection
- OS Command Injection
- DLL Hijacking
- Privilege Escalation
- [CVE-2023-36923](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-36923)

**Reason and Prerequisites**
- **SAP PowerDesigner Client** connecting to bundled "SQL Anywhere for PowerDesigner" through ODBC could lead to command injection.
- **SAP PowerDesigner Proxy** connecting to bundled "SQL Anywhere for PowerDesigner" through ODBC could lead to command injection with privilege escalation.

**Solution**
The fix was implemented by bundling a more recent version of SQL Anywhere 17 that does not load custom unicode extension DLL by default.

**Upgrade to:**
- **SAP SQLA FOR POWERDESIGNER 17** SP07 PL01 released on 13 June, 2023
  - Corresponding to an "SQL Anywhere 17" SP01 PL11.

> **Note:** This can be done independently from upgrading "SAP PowerDesigner Client" and "SAP PowerDesigner Proxy".

**Workaround**
Please assess the workaround applicability for your SAP landscape prior to implementation. Note that this workaround is a temporary fix and is not a permanent solution. SAP strongly recommends you apply the corrections outlined in the security note, which can be done in lieu of the workaround or after the workaround is implemented.

As a workaround, ask the system administrator to create a `\bin64\` folder with severely restricted permissions so that NO normal users can write to it (nor delete it).

**Affected Components**
- **SYBASE POWERDESIGNER CLIENT:** Version 16.7
- **SYBASE POWERDESIGNER PROXY:** Version 16.7

**CVSS Details**
- **Score:** 7.8 (High)
- **Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
