### Description

**Symptom**  
Username is hard coded in a portion of a code which is no longer relevant. The code containing the hard coded username has been added for internal testing and does not affect the business process. It cannot harm any component. Hence, implementing this note cannot cause any kind of damage.

**Other Terms**  
- Hard coded User Name  
- Backdoor

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
Hard-coded user names (Backdoor)

The program code contains a hard-coded username which changes the system's behavior should a user authenticate successfully. The username was hard coded in the include file `/SAPAPO/LRET_SURFACE_RPF77`, which is not compliant with security standards.

Please implement the note and make the necessary corrections accordingly.
