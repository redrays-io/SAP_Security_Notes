1427008 - Authorization check for SRM Analysis Cockpit Tool

## Symptom

A vulnerability exists in the SRM Analysis Cockpit Tool, part of the SAP Supplier Relationship Management (SAP SRM) solution, allowing hackers to access restricted SAP transactions at runtime. This can lead to:

1. **Manipulation of Business Logic:** Resulting in inconsistent data states.
2. **Regulatory Compliance Violations:** Unprivileged access to critical business logic may breach compliance requirements.

## Affected Releases

- SAP SRM 5.0
- SAP SRM 6.0
- SAP SRM 7.0

## Reason and Prerequisites

This issue is caused by missing authorization checks during dynamic calls to transactions from SRM programs. Without proper authorization, malicious users can control these transaction calls, posing significant security risks.

## Solution

Implement the provided corrections to address the vulnerability. The dynamic transaction calls are now validated using appropriate authority checks, ensuring that only authorized users can execute the transactions.
