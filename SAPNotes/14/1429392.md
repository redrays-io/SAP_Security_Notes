**SAP Note/KBA:** 1429392  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Release Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 14.12.2010  
**Component:** Basis Components > Enterprise Service Infrastructure > Web Service Infrastructure > Web Service and SOAP - Java > Configuration  
**Title:** Unauthorized modification of displayed content in WSNavigator

### Symptom
The WSNavigator in SAP NetWeaver 640 and 7.00 could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
- WSNavigator
- Security
- XSS
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

### Reason and Prerequisites
The WSNavigator component within Web Application Server Java does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This flaw can be exploited to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a website. Additionally, attackers could steal another user's authentication information, enabling them to impersonate the user and access information with the same privileges. If an administrator is impersonated, the application's security could be fully compromised.

### Solution
Apply the corresponding service pack or patch level for the appropriate releases or upgrade to SAP NetWeaver 7.10 or higher, where this issue has been resolved.

### Affected Software Components
- **SAP_JTECHS:** 6.40 to 6.40, 7.00 to 7.02
- **SAP_J2EE_ENGINE 6.40**
- **SAP_JAVA_TECH_SERVICES 7.00** to **7.02**
