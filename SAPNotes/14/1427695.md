1427695 - Security Note: Restriction on attachment file types in BPM

**SAP Security Note 1427695** addresses a critical security enhancement in SAP NetWeaver Business Process Management (BPM). 

### **Symptom**
Prior to SAP NW BPM 7.20 SP0, there was no mechanism to restrict the types of files that could be attached to BPM tasks and processes. This posed a risk of attaching potentially dangerous files with active content aimed at compromising users.

### **Solution**
To mitigate this risk, SAP introduced the ability to restrict attachment file types starting with SAP NW BPM 7.20. The key steps to implement this restriction are:

1. **Upgrade** to SAP NW BPM 7.20 or a later version.
2. **Configure File Type Restrictions**:
   - Log in to SAP NetWeaver Administrator.
   - Navigate to **Configuration Management** → **Infrastructure** → **Java System Properties**.
   - Select the **Applications** tab and choose the `tc~bpem~base~ear` application.
   - Modify the `context.attachments.extensions` property by entering a comma-separated list of allowed file extensions (e.g., `txt, jpg, zip, doc`).
   - Save the changes to enforce the restrictions.

Only files with the specified extensions will be permitted as attachments to BPM tasks and processes. If no value is set for `context.attachments.extensions`, there will be no file type restrictions, and all file types will be allowed.
