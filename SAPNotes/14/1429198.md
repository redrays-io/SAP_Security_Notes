1429198 - Missing authorization check in RSUDO for "Execute as"

## Symptom

Certain functions of transaction RSUDO can be called without the logged-on user having the prerequisite authorization for them. This can lead to an escalation of privileges.

When you execute a query with another user ("Execution as User") in transaction RSUDO, the system checks only during the initial start whether the user has sufficient authorization to execute the transaction with the entered user.

## Reason and Prerequisites

This problem is caused by a program error.

Transaction RSUDO does not have authorization checks that regulate repeated access to functions. Without these checks, a logged-on user can call these functions multiple times, leading to the possibility of an unwanted change in the system behavior.
