1430587 - Missing authorization check two NWA plug-ins

## Description

**Symptom**
An authenticated read-only user can use the full functionality of the "Destinations" and the "Session monitoring" NWA plug-ins although no modifications should be possible in these plug-ins for read-only users. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Other Terms**
Authorization, authorization check, Destinations, Session monitoring

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The "Destinations" and "Session monitoring" NWA plug-ins do not correctly maintain the checks of the authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**
Upgrade your SAP J2EE Engine to:
- **SAP J2EE Engine 701 - SP07**
- **SAP J2EE Engine 702 - SP04**
