2105633 - Missing authorization check in Alert Management Interface

**Description**

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use functions of the Alert Management Interface to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Other Terms**

Authorization, authorization check, Alert Management Interface

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Alert Monitoring Interface does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

Please implement the Support Package mentioned in this SAP Note or follow the correction instructions.

With the correction RFC enabled, functions of the Alert Management Interface grant access only to data for the current user or to users with `S_ALM_CUST` authorization.
