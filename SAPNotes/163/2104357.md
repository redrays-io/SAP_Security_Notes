2104357 - Bypass of Filter in SAP Internet Communication Manager

## Symptom

An authenticated user can use functions of SAP Internet Communication Manager and SAP Web Dispatcher to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

URL Filters of SAP Internet Communication Manager and SAP Web Dispatcher can be bypassed using a specifically crafted URL.

## Reason and Prerequisites

SAP Internet Communication Manager and SAP Web Dispatcher do not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access certain functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

Additionally, SAP Internet Communication Manager and SAP Web Dispatcher fail to map all URLs with the filter definition. Consequently, the request will be forwarded to the SAP application server, where authentication occurs.
