2105793 - Fixing POODLE SSLv3 Vulnerability for Agentry

### **Description**

**Symptom**

Agentry 6.0.48 and Agentry 6.1.4 are susceptible to the 'POODLE' vulnerability. As reported in [CVE-2014-3566](https://me.sap.com/notes/2086818), a man-in-the-middle attack is possible, even if the newer protocol version TLS 1.0 is enabled or configured alongside SSLv3.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The Agentry Server component is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks by downgrading to SSL 3.0, even if both sides of the connection support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 uses nondeterministic CBC padding, making it easier for attackers to obtain clear text data via a padding-oracle attack, known as the "POODLE" issue.

**Solution**

- **For Agentry Server 6.0.48 or earlier:** Upgrade to Agentry 6.0.50 or greater.
- **For Agentry Server 6.1.4 in SMP 2.3 SP04 PL01 (and earlier versions):** Upgrade to SMP 2.3 SP05 or greater, which corresponds to Agentry versions 6.1.5.49 or greater.

The latest Agentry components for SMP 2.3 can be downloaded from the [SAP Software Download Center](https://me.sap.com/Installations_and_Upgrades/A_Z_Index/"M"/SAP_Mobile_Platform/Support_Packages) and the [SAP Mobile Platform SDK](https://me.sap.com/Installations_and_Upgrades/A_Z_Index/"M"/SAP_Mobile_Platform_SDK/Support_Packages).
