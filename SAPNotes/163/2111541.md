### Reason and Prerequisites
The correction instructions in security note 1965819 for 7.0, 7.01, and 7.02 were accidentally delivered with a very small validity range. The security note change process at SAP requires a new note to extend this validity. If you can apply security note 1965819, nothing needs to be done, and this note does not need to be applied. If you cannot apply note 1965819 in older support packages, please use this note to apply the corrections.

### Solution
Apply the note only if you cannot apply note 1965819 and you cannot upgrade to a higher support package level.
