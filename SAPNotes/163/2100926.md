SAP Security Note 2100926: Switchable Authorization Checks for RFC in SEM-BCS

**Overview**

SAP Security Note [2100926](https://me.sap.com/notes/2100926) introduces new switchable authorization checks for RFC function modules in SEM-BCS. This enhancement aims to strengthen system security by ensuring that remote calls to RFC function modules are adequately protected.

**Symptom**

Remote calls to RFC function modules are currently protected by the `S_RFC` authorization object. However, `S_RFC` alone may not suffice to ensure secure execution for certain RFC function modules within SEM-BCS. This gap necessitates the activation of additional authorization checks.

**Solution**

The SAP Note implements new switchable authorization checks that are initially inactive to maintain compatibility with existing processes. These checks can be activated using transaction **SACF**. Detailed steps for activation are provided in the manual correction instructions included with the note.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure that the following SAP Notes are applied before implementing this security note:

- [1988903](https://me.sap.com/notes/1988903) – Check whether a function module was called via external RFC
- [1995667](https://me.sap.com/notes/1995667) – SACF: Navigation error

**Manual Activities**

Activation steps involve creating and assigning the authorization scenario in **SACF** and ensuring that the new authorization object `R_RSSEM` is properly configured. Detailed instructions are provided within the note.
