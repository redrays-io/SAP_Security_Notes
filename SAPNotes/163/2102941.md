2102941 - Update 1 to Security Note 1686632

**SAP Security Note 2102941** provides an important update to **Security Note 1686632**, addressing clarity issues for specific SAP releases and kernel versions. Here's a summary of the key information:

### Symptom
The original SAP Note 1686632 was unclear for:
- Releases 620 and 640
- Releases from 700 onwards in conjunction with kernel versions 720 and 721

When using a synchronous RFC in ABAP, the RFC destination "BACK" allows executing remote-enabled modules in the RFC caller's context, provided the caller has the necessary RFC authorizations and the callback isn't prohibited by `RFC_CALLBACK_REJECTED` (refer to [SAP Note 1515925](https://me.sap.com/notes/1515925)).

**Note:** RFC callbacks are only supported during synchronous RFCs. They are **not** supported during asynchronous, transactional, or background RFCs.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Using the ABAP statement `CALL FUNCTION <func> DESTINATION <DEST>` to call a synchronous RFC allows, within the remote function module (`<func>`), the use of a synchronous RFC with the predefined destination "BACK". This is achieved via `CALL FUNCTION <funcBack> DESTINATION 'BACK'` (RFC callback).

**Prerequisite:** If the RFC authorization check is activated (see [SAP Note 93254](https://me.sap.com/notes/93254)) on the calling side, the caller must have the necessary RFC authorization. Otherwise, executing `<funcBack>` will terminate with an error.
