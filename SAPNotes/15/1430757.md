1430757 - Super user feature in SNC

**SAP Note 1430757 - Super user feature in SNC**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 4  
**Released On:** 19.09.2013  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  

### Description

#### Symptom
SNC offers a super user functionality for certain UIs, allowing a user without a business partner assignment to access all data authorized by their user role. Due to security concerns, this functionality will not be supported by default anymore.

#### Reason
Program error

#### Solution
- **Disable Super User by Default:** If a user is not assigned to a business partner, SNC will no longer display any menu entries and will issue the following message:
  ```
  Message class: /SCMB/MDL_BASIC, number: 102, text: User & is not assigned to a partner.
  ```
- **Enable Super User Functionality (If Needed):**
  - Implement BAdI `/SCF/UIMDL_BUSINESS_PARTNER` included in the enhancement spot `/SCF/UIMDL_APPCUST`.
  - The fallback class used when no BAdI implementation is found is `/SCF/CL_UIMDL_BUSINESS_PARTNER`.
- **Unchanged Functionalities:**
  - The default super user functionality remains unchanged in the customer view of the service parts planning solution.
  - The super user functionality remains unchanged in SNC Responsive Replenishment.
