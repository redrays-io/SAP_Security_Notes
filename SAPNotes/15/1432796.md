1432796 - Session ID not regenerated after logon

**Description**

**Symptom**
When initiating communication with a SAP Business Connector and performing a logon, the session ID cookie is not regenerated after a successful logon. Instead, the original cookie from the `www-authenticate` response continues to be used. Additionally, such a session is logged with an incorrect username. In the session overview UI, the correct logged-in user is displayed, but the log shows the previous user.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The Business Connector does not switch to a different session during the logon cycle; it merely updates the associated user. This issue occurs in:
- Business Connector 4.7 up to version CoreFix 9
- Business Connector 4.8 up to version CoreFix 2

**Solution**
The Business Connector has been updated to use a new session when switching users during a re-logon cycle.

- **Business Connector 4.7:** Apply CoreFix 10.
- **Business Connector 4.8:** Apply at least CoreFix 3.

**Additional Notes:**
If this note is applied to a Reverse Invoke configuration, ensure that all involved Business Connector servers have the mentioned Core Fixes installed. Additionally, verify that both the internal and external Business Connector servers are on the same release version (mixing 4.7 and 4.8 is no longer supported).

For more details, you can refer to the [SAP Note 1432796](https://me.sap.com/notes/1432796).
