SAP Security Note 1432682 - Session ID is written to logs

**Description:**

**Symptom:**
The session ID sent in the `ssnid` cookie to the Business Connector is written as-is into the logs/traces of the Business Connector.

**Potential Impact:**
If an attacker gains access to these logs during the session's lifetime, they could hijack the session.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
The session ID was utilized to associate multiple log entries for better supportability. The affected versions are:
- **Business Connector 4.7** up to **CoreFix 9**
- **Business Connector 4.8** up to **CoreFix 1**

**Solution:**
An internal session ID has been introduced to maintain supportability without logging the client-sent session ID.

**Actions Required:**
- **Business Connector 4.7:** Apply **CoreFix 10**.
- **Business Connector 4.8:** Apply at least **CoreFix 2**.

*Note:* If you are using a Reverse Invoke configuration, ensure that all involved Business Connector servers have the specified Core Fixes installed and that both internal and external Business Connector servers are on the same release version (mixing versions like 4.7 and 4.8 is not supported).

**Affected Software Components:**
- **SAP BC 4.7**
- **SAP BC 4.8**
