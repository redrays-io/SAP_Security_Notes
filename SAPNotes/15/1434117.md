1434117 - Bypassing sec_info without reg_info

**SAP Security Note 1434117 - Bypassing sec_info without reg_info**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 4  
**Released On:** August 26, 2010  
**Component:** Basis Components > Client/Server Technology > Gateway/CPIC

### Description
This security note addresses a kernel error that allows bypassing security controls related to program restarting and registering. Specifically, if the `gw/reg_info` parameter is not set, the system continues to use only the `gw/sec_info` file for both restarting and registering programs. This can potentially allow unauthorized restarting of external programs for which no specific security rules are defined.

### Affected Systems
- **SAP Kernel Versions:**  
  - 31I
  - 40B
  - 45B
  - 46D
  - 640
  - 700 to 730
  - 7.00 to 7.20

### Symptom
Without setting the `gw/reg_info` parameter (applicable up to and including Kernel Release 7.11), the system uses only the `gw/sec_info` file to manage both restarting and registering programs. This may enable the restarting of external programs without proper security validations.

### Reason
The issue is caused by a kernel error that fails to separate the rules for restarting and registering programs when `gw/reg_info` is not configured.

### Solution
To mitigate this security gap, perform the following actions:

1. **Apply Relevant Patch Levels:**
   - **31I_EXT:** Patch level 785
   - **40B_EXT:** Patch level 1074
   - **45B_EXT:** Patch level 1005

2. **Configure Instance Profile Parameter:**
   - Set `gw/reg_no_conn_info` as specified in [Note 1444282](https://me.sap.com/notes/1444282) based on your target security level.

3. **Update `sec_info` and `reg_info` Files:**
   - For Kernel Releases 31I to 46D, perform manual post-implementation steps to update the `sec_info` file.
   - For Kernel Release 640 and higher, create separate `sec_info` and `reg_info` files to define restarting and registering programs independently.

4. **Ensure Proper Configuration:**
   - When `gw/reg_no_conn_info` is set, registrations cannot be performed without the `reg_info` file defined by `gw/reg_info`.
