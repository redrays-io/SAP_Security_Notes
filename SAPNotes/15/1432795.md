1432795 - Support for additional Cookie attributes

**SAP Note Number**: 1432795  
**Title**: Support for additional Cookie attributes  
**Type**: SAP Security Note  
**Version**: 3  
**Released On**: 17.03.2010  
**Component**: Basis Components > Middleware > Business Connector

## Description

### Symptom
The Business Connector can be abused by a malicious user to modify application content and persist the changes without authorization. Additionally, the session ID cookie is sent without attributes, potentially allowing the theft of authentication information from legitimate users.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The Business Connector has not been utilizing the HTTP attributes introduced in recent years to protect its session ID cookie against XSS attacks in client-side browsers. This omission allows attackers to:
- Permanently modify displayed content on a website.
- Embed automatically rendered malicious content without targeting individual victims.
- Steal authentication information, enabling user impersonation and potential full compromise of the application's security.

The affected versions are:
- Business Connector 4.7 up to CoreFix 9
- Business Connector 4.8 up to CoreFix 2

### Solution
Implement the following measures to enhance cookie security:
- **HttpOnly Attribute**: Now sent with the session ID cookie to prevent JavaScript access.
- **Secure Attribute**: Can be enabled by setting the `server.cnf` variable `watt.net.cookies.useSecure` to `true`, ensuring cookies are only sent over HTTPS.

**Action Steps:**
- **Business Connector 4.7**: Apply **CoreFix 10**.
- **Business Connector 4.8**: Apply at least **CoreFix 3**.

**Note**: If applying this note to a Reverse Invoke configuration, ensure that Core Fixes are installed on all involved Business Connector servers and that both internal and external servers are on the same release version (mixing 4.7 and 4.8 is not supported).
