### Description

#### Symptom
This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see [Security Note 1589554](https://me.sap.com/notes/1589554).

Web Services war file has insecure default configuration which could allow someone to take control of the web services deployed on Business Objects Enterprise. This could then allow the attacker to take control of the machine hosting the web service.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Default credentials in the axis2 component of Business Objects Web Services could allow an attacker to control the status of the web services.

#### Solution
Customers should apply Business Objects enterprise FP2.5 or higher.  
Edge customers can apply FP 2.5 or higher.

If immediate installation of the patch is not possible, users should change the default administrator password. This can be done by modifying the password value within `axis2.xml` in the `dswsbobje` war file under the `WEB-INF\conf` directory.
