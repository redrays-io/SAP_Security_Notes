**Overview**
- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Priority:** Correction with high priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer
- **Released On:** 09.02.2010
- **Category:** Program error
- **Component:** Supplier Relationship Management > SRM > Legal Contract Authoring (SRM-EBP-LCA)
- **Version:** 3

**Symptom**
The SRM Legal Contract Authoring Duet application can be exploited by a malicious user to obtain privileges beyond their current authorization levels. This vulnerability allows an attacker to impersonate another user, potentially leading to a full compromise of the application's security, especially if an administrator account is targeted.

**Pre-requisites**
Running business logic with different user privileges is dangerous as it impairs accountability. An attacker with access to this data may impersonate another user and access information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, it can lead to a complete security compromise of the application.
