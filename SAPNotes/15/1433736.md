SAP Security Note 1433736 - Security Note: Automatic execution of BPM task attachments

### Description

**Symptom**

Certain types of attachments to BPM tasks and processes are recognized by the browser and automatically executed upon download, e.g., JavaScript files. This creates a potential risk of executing malicious active content. Since BPM as a platform is not intended for use with open user groups (i.e., anonymous users), the risk is rated low.

**Other Terms**

Galaxy, SAP NW BPM, Business Process Management, attachments

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The issue was caused by an incorrect `Content-Disposition` HTTP header in the response of requests for downloading attachments.

**Solution**

Upgrade to SAP NW BPM 7.20 or a subsequent version.
