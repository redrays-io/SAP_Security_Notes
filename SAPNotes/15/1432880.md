### **Temporary Workaround**
Customers are recommended to refer to the administration guide, **Chapter 5 - Working with Firewalls**, to implement firewall protection as a workaround. Alternatively, you can temporarily delete the `crheapalloc.dll` file from the system until the patch is installed. **Note:** Deleting this file may cause performance degradation for Crystal Reports workflows. Ensure that the `crheapalloc.dll` file is restored before installing the patch containing the fix.
