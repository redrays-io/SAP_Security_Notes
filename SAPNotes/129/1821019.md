1821019 - Missing authorization check in package SPFL

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use certain functions of SAP systems without having the required authorization for this.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 2.3
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:A/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

This CVSS Base Score provided by SAP is used to estimate the risk posed by the issue reported in this SAP Note. However, this estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

SAP systems do not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of their functions. Without these checks, an authenticated user can call these functions without this being the desired system behavior.
