1820305 - Potential Information Disclosure Relating to Passwords: LDAP

**SAP Security Note 1820305** addresses a critical vulnerability where an attacker can discover information related to passwords of LDAP directory servers. This information could be leveraged to tailor attacks specifically against LDAP directory servers, potentially compromising system security.

### Symptom
An attacker may exploit this vulnerability to access password information of LDAP directory servers, facilitating more targeted and effective attacks.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Sensitive information, such as LDAP directory server passwords, can be retrieved through a database table lookup. This compromised information can be used by attackers to further target and breach LDAP directory servers.

### Solution
A support package or correction request is available to mitigate this issue. Specifically, the maintenance of the "LDAP System User" (`LDAPUSER`) now restricts the selection of "Credential storage = Simple Memory." For entries previously using this option, a warning is displayed in the "Display View 'LDAP System User': Details" screen. To resolve:
1. Enter edit mode for the LDAP system user.
2. Switch from "Simple Memory" to "Secure Storage."
3. Upon saving, the password is transferred to secure storage, and the simple memory entry is deleted.
