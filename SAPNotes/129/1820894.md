1820894 - Security fix for SLM treating XXE vulnerability

**SAP Security Note 1820894 - Security Fix for SLM Treating XXE Vulnerability**

**Symptom**

A malicious user can modify an XML-based request to include XML content that is then parsed locally. This could allow a malicious user to perform a denial of service (DoS) on the parsing system, disclose local data that is returned in the response to the malicious request, or access further network-located resources accessible from the parsing system.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.0
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you should conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).*

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The issue is caused by a program error in SLM due to the incorrect use of an XML parser. By default, the parser opens external entities referenced within an XML input, which can lead to malicious content being parsed. This malicious content can reference internal resources, such as files, which can be disclosed in the response to the request or used to perform a denial of service attack on the parsing system, rendering application content temporarily unavailable.
