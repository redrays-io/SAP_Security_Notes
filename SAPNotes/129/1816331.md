1816331 - Code injection vulnerability in BC-SRV-ALV

**Symptom**

BC-SRV-ALV contains code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice. An attacker can therefore control the behavior of the system or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without having their own legitimate credentials.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.0
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

*Note:* SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this SAP Note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/) at SAP.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The program code contains the ability to define and execute user-defined code that changes the behavior of the system. A valid and authenticated user is required. Depending on the code, the user can:

- Inject and run their own code
- Obtain additional information that should not be displayed
- Modify or delete data
- Modify the system's output
- Create new users with higher privileges
