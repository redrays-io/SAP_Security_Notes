2001778 - Security Improvements for MOB-APP-BI-AND

**Description**

### Symptom

- SAP BusinessObjects Mobile (SAP BI) allows the use of self-signed certificates which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks and code injections.
- An attacker can discover information of locally stored data which could be used to specialize their attacks against SAP BusinessObjects Mobile (SAP BI).
- Other mobile applications can modify application content related to SAP BusinessObjects Mobile (SAP BI) and persist the modified content without authorization.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 5.4
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:A/AC:M/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Reason and Prerequisites

Information such as business analytics can be discovered using MOB-APP-BI-AND (SAP BusinessObjects Mobile for Android version 5.0.x). The issue is caused because of the following reasons:

- The application did not validate the server certificates.
- The application did not mark its content provider as non-exportable.
- The application stored sensitive information using non-secure techniques.

### Solution

- Self-signed certificates are no longer allowed for Android devices having Operating System versions 4.0 and above.
- Secure techniques are used to process and store sensitive information.

These problems have been resolved in **SAP BusinessObjects Mobile v5.1.32**, which is available in the [Google Play Store](https://me.sap.com/notes/2001778).
