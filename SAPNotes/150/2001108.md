An attacker can remotely exploit servers in BusinessIntelligence Platform by manipulating the BIP process to read outside its memory space. A denial-of-service may occur.

**CVSS Information**  
- **CVSS Base Score:** 5.0 / 10  
- **CVSS Base Vector:**  
  | Key                       | Value              |
  |---------------------------|--------------------|
  | AV : Access Vector        | Network (N)        |
  | AC : Access Complexity    | Low (L)            |
  | Au : Authentication       | None (N)           |
  | C : Impact to Confidentiality | None (N)       |

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

#### Other Terms
Memory corruption, BI-BIP

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The issue is caused by memory corruption that causes the BI Platform processes to terminate. An attacker can induce the condition when a process attempts to read outside its memory space. A memory protection fault will lead the system to terminate the process, thus rendering the application unusable until it is restarted manually.
