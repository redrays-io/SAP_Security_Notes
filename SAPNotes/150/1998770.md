1998770 - Unauthorized change of stored content through manipulation of BC-BMT-WFM

**Description**

### Symptom
An attacker can cause a stored cross-site scripting problem by manipulating BC-BMT-WFM.

### Other Terms
XSS

### Reason and Prerequisites
Stored cross-site scripting can be used to permanently modify the displayed content of a Web site, allowing the attacker to embed content that is then generated and displayed automatically, without having to target victims individually.

### Solution
Following the implementation of the attached corrections or the import of the corresponding Support Packages, BC-BMT-WFM uses the virus scan profile that is active for the SAPoffice environment. With regard to this, see the profile set in the parameter `SO_VSI_PROFILE` in the table `SXPARAMS`.
