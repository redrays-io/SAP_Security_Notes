2006177 - Upgrade to a non-vulnerable OpenSSL version to resolve Heartbleed Bug in Business One installations

### Symptom
A vulnerability was found with some OpenSSL versions. This vulnerability is referred to as the "Heartbleed Bug" and poses grave threats to users' data security. The OpenSSL Project made a statement regarding this issue at [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt). For more information, see [http://heartbleed.com/](http://heartbleed.com/).

As of SAP Business One 9.0 and SAP Business One 9.0 version for SAP HANA, SAP Business One uses OpenSSL to encrypt communication; for some components (for example, the license service), OpenSSL is mandatory. To acquire the installation program for OpenSSL, customers should go to the official site [http://www.openssl.org/](http://www.openssl.org/) for download and pay attention to announced vulnerabilities when downloading OpenSSL libraries.

In the case of customers using SAP Business One products powered by SAP HANA, OpenSSL is usually (but not necessarily) a default component of the SuSE Linux server. SAP Business One currently supports SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1, SP2, and SP3; the operating system images contain OpenSSL 0.9.8 versions and are not affected. However, you must check OpenSSL versions on your Windows workstations and servers that run components such as SBO Mailer; and we highly recommend that you double-check OpenSSL versions on your Linux server.

### Other Terms
SSL/TLS, encryption, OpenSSL library, Heartbleed bug, openSSL Vulnerability, CVE-2014-0160

### Reason and Prerequisites
If you are using any of the affected OpenSSL versions, you must upgrade your OpenSSL library. Versions announced as vulnerable are:

- 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive)
- 1.0.2-beta, including 1.0.2-beta1

**Note that SAP Business One does not support beta versions of OpenSSL. The beta versions are listed here only because they are affected by the said vulnerability.**

### Solution
Affected product installation must upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.1g or higher (excluding beta versions). If you are using any of the following SAP Business One products, you must ensure that your OpenSSL libraries are not affected by the Heartbleed Bug:

- SAP Business One 9.0 and higher versions
- SAP Business One 9.0, version for SAP HANA and higher versions

All SUSE Linux Enterprise Server versions are **not** affected by the Heartbleed bug. Therefore, for SAP Business One, version for SAP HANA users, only the Windows client workstations may be affected.

To check whether you need to upgrade OpenSSL on your Windows server or any of your Windows client workstations:

1. Go to the Control Panel and choose *Programs and Features*.
2. In the list of programs, find whether OpenSSL is installed.
3. If OpenSSL is displayed in the list, check its version in the *Details* view.

If your OpenSSL versions are affected by the Heartbleed Bug, you must download a new version that fixes the bug and install it, as below:

1. Go to [http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html](http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html).
2. Click the "OpenSSL for Windows" link.
3. Go to the corresponding page to download an installer compatible with your operating system.
