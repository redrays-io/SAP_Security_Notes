### Description

#### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functions of **IS-A-DP** to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

#### CVSS Information
- **Base Score:** 6.0 / 10
- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
- **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium (M)
- **Authentication (Au):** Single (S)
- **Impact to Confidentiality (C):** Partial (P)
- **Impact to Integrity (I):** Partial (P)
- **Impact to Availability (A):** Partial (P)

_SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment._

#### Reason and Prerequisites
**IS-A-DP** does not contain required checks against a positive set of allowed functions (i.e., whitelist) during execution of these functions. This is required to verify that authenticated users are allowed to access these functions. The missing check may result in undesired system behavior.
