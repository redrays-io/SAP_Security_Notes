### Description

**Symptom**  
A malicious user can be authenticated to EA-GLTRADE without having their own legitimate credentials, or they may escalate privileges.

**Other Terms**  
Backdoor, hard-coded, credentials, EA-GLTRADE

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
The vulnerability is caused by a hard-coded username-password combination in the program's source code. A malicious user who specifies these credentials can log on to the system without having been assigned legitimate access by the system administrator(s). If a user already has privileges with which they can log on, an escalation of privileges may be possible if the hard-coded account has higher access rights than the original user.

**Solution**  
To solve the error, implement the changes contained in the attached correction instructions in your system.
