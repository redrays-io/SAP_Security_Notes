### Description

**Symptom:**  
A malicious user can remotely exploit kernel processes to terminate them manually.

**Other Terms:**  
Memory corruption, kernel

**Reason and Prerequisites:**  
The issue is caused by a memory corruption that forces the process to terminate. A malicious user can induce a condition where the process attempts to read outside its memory space, resulting in a memory protection fault. Consequently, the system terminates the process, rendering the application unusable until it is manually restarted.

### Solution

Upgrade to the current kernel version as specified in the Validity section of the note.

### Affected Software Components

Multiple versions of the SAP Kernel are affected, including but not limited to:

- **KRNL32NUC**
- **KRNL32UC**
- **KRNL64NUC**
- **KRNL64UC**
- **KERNEL**
