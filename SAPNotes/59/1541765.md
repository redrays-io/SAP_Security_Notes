SAP Security Note 1541765 - Security Issues in SAML 1.1 Browser/Artifact Profile

**Description**

This SAP Security Note addresses several security vulnerabilities in the SAML 1.1 Browser/Artifact Profile implementation within the AS Java environment. The affected web applications include "SAML SSO Demo Application" and "SAML SSO Application". The key issues are:

1. **Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content**  
   Malicious users can modify application content without authorization, potentially stealing authentication information from other users.

2. **Unauthorized Use of Application Functions**  
   Certain functions can be executed without proper authentication and authorization, allowing malicious users to perform unauthorized actions.

3. **Escalation of Privileges**  
   Authenticated users can gain access to other users' applications and privileges through the SAML SSO Demo Application.

4. **Potential False Redirection of Website Content**  
   Enables phishing attacks by redirecting users to malicious sites, tricking them into revealing sensitive information.

**Solution**

1. **Install the Relevant Support Package**  
   Apply the support package listed in this SAP Note to address the identified vulnerabilities.

2. **Immediate Countermeasure: Disable the SAML SSO Demo Application**  
   - **For NetWeaver 7.10 and Higher:**
     - Navigate to ConfigTool.
     - Switch to "Expert Mode".
     - Go to "Filters".
     - Set Action to "Disable", Component to "application", Vendor Mask to "sap.com", and Component Name Mask to "tc~sec~saml~ssodemoapp".
   
   - **For SAP NetWeaver 6.40 and 7.0x:**
     - Ensure the SAML Service is not started by checking in Visual Administrator under "Services" â†’ "SAML".
     - If using SAML, disable the demo application by removing all login modules in the Policy Configurations for "sap.com/tc~sec~app*samlssodemo_source".
