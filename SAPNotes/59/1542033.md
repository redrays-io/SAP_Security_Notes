1542033 - Update #1 for security note 1497003

**Description**

### Symptom

**Update 21-07-2016**: This note has been re-released after adding the required validity. The update contains no new corrections.

**Update 02 February 2011**  
Due to issues in SNOTE depending on release and support package it was necessary to significantly change the correction instructions for note 1497003.  
Note 1497003 in its new version now only contains correction instructions for objects which are **not** included in the transport request. The complete set of correction instructions was moved to note **1543851**. Please refer to the manual pre-implementation steps of note **1497003** for further details.  
If you already applied note 1497003 you do **not** need to apply the updated version of note 1497003. No additional corrections were added.

### Solution

If you have not yet applied note 1497003, apply the corrections as described in the note. Be very careful to carry out the steps as described and in the correct order.  
If you do not carry out the steps as described in note 1497003 you will create a syntax error in one of the central function groups of your system and make your system unusable. Please refer to [note 1550116](https://me.sap.com/notes/1550116) for additional information.  
If you have already applied a previous version of note 1497003 it is not necessary to implement the note again.
