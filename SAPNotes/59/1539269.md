1539269 - Potential remote code execution in Crystal Server

**Symptom**

A malicious user can exploit a vulnerability in an ActiveX control of SAP Crystal Server 2008, with the possible consequence of a complete system compromise.

**Other Terms**

Buffer overrun, RCE, remote code execution, SAP Crystal Server 2008, CrystalReports12.CrystalPrintControl.1, ActiveX control, PrintControl.dll

**Reason and Prerequisites**

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in an ActiveX control of SAP Crystal Server 2008. This enables a malicious user to inject code into the working memory that is subsequently executed by the process. The attacker may use this to gain control of the target system. For the overflow to occur, the victim must be tricked into visiting a specially crafted web page, using the system with the vulnerable control installed.

**Solution**

*Patch:*

XIR3 customers should install Fixpack 2.11 or 3.4.

*Workaround:*

Customers without the fixpack can disable ActiveX (active scripting) in the Internet Explorer settings or set the killbit for this control in the registry.

The relevant ClassID for this control is **88DD90B6-C770-4CFF-B7A4-3AFD16BB8824**.
