### Description

#### Symptom
A malicious user can trick a user with elevated authorizations to run a report that creates users and RFC destinations with hardcoded usernames and passwords. This can potentially be used to exploit other vulnerabilities in the system.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The problem is caused by hardcoded usernames and passwords. The affected reports are protected by a special authorization object, allowing only users with elevated rights to run the report. These reports are usually not needed, so executing them would be unusual for a system administrator.

#### Solution
To resolve the issue, implement the changes contained in the attached correction instructions in your system.  
**This note corrects code that is only used internally by SAP and not in customer systems. No testing is required after applying the note.**
