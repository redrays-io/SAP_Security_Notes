### Reason and Prerequisites

A DLL hijacking vulnerability exists in Crystal Reports Designer. This enables a malicious user to load code into the process memory of the application. This code is then executed by the application.

### Solution

To avoid loading DLLs from network paths via CRW, the current folder will not be included in the search path. Related ADAPT ID is ADAPT01474509. Customers do not need to perform any additional actions besides upgrading their environment to the proper patch level (above FP 2.12 or FP 3.3).
