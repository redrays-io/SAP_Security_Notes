### **Note Details**
- **Number:** 668256
- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Version:** 11
- **Recency:** New
- **Language:** English (Master Language: German)
- **Category:** Program error
- **Priority:** Correction with low priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer
- **Released On:** 08.10.2009
- **Component:** Basis Components > Middleware > Internet Communication Framework (BC-MID-ICF)

### **Description**
This security note provides guidance on using HTTP debugging or external debugging to debug RFC or HTTP/HTTPS/SMTP sessions within SAP systems.

### **Prerequisites and Setup**
1. **User Login:**
   - Use SAPGUI to log on to the server from which RFC or HTTP/HTTPS/SMTP calls are made.
   - Preferably, use the same user for both the RFC/HTTP logon and the debugging session.

2. **Load Distribution:**
   - Debugging with load distribution is not supported.
   - Reconfigure the application to route calls to a specific server during debugging.

3. **User Sessions:**
   - Avoid debugging collective user sessions due to high simultaneous calls.
   - Use a dedicated user for executing the application during debugging.

4. **Activating Debugging:**
   - Access the Development Workbench (DWB) transactions (e.g., SE37, SE38, SE80).
   - Navigate to `Utilities` → `Settings ...` → `ABAP Editor` → `Debugging`.
   - Enter the user session to be debugged, activate the "Active" checkbox, and deactivate the "IP Matching" checkbox.

5. **Authorizations:**
   - Ensure the user has the necessary authorizations to activate and set breakpoints in ABAP reports. Refer to [SAP Note 668252](https://me.sap.com/notes/668252) for more information.

6. **Setting Breakpoints:**
   - In the ABAP report (methods, function modules, includes, etc.), select "HTTP/external debugging" when setting breakpoints.

### **Important Notes**
- Debugging sessions must remain active; otherwise, the debugging engine cannot establish a connection for new SAPGUI sessions.
- The validity period for HTTP/external debugging is limited to 2 hours. Reactivate breakpoints for longer debugging sessions.
- External breakpoints are stored in the database and persist after logging off. However, external debugging must be reactivated upon each login.
- **Known Issue:** Activating external debugging for usernames that are substrings of other usernames (e.g., 'POWERUSER' affects 'POWER') may create unintended breakpoints.

### **Solution**
HTTP/external debugging was introduced in Release 620 with patch level 1186 under the patch text "HTTP/External Debugging for RFC (II)". Subsequent corrections address known issues:
- **Patch Text "HTTP/External Debugging for RFC (III)":**
  - For Release 620 with patch level 1320
  - For Release 640 with patch level 2

Additional support and descriptions for the `rfc/ext_debugging` profile parameter can be found in [Support Package SAPKB62031](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB62031) for Release 620.

### **Support Packages**
- [SAPKB62031](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB62031) – SAP_BASIS 620
- [SAPKB62038](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB62038) – SAP_BASIS 620
- [SAPKB64001](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB64001) – SAP_BASIS 640

- [Authorization check for HTTP/external debugging](https://me.sap.com/notes/668252)

### **Known Problems**
- **User Name Conflicts:** Activating external debugging for users with names that are substrings of other usernames can lead to unintended breakpoint activations.
- **Session Reactivation:** External debugging must be reactivated after each login as it is session-related.
