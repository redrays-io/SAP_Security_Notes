SAP Security Note 668252 - Authorization check for HTTP/external debugging

**SAP Note Number:** 668252  
**Title:** Authorization check for HTTP/external debugging  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Released On:** 08.10.2009

### Symptom
The activation of HTTP or external debugging for other users is not allowed.

### Reason and Prerequisites
For security reasons, an extended authorization check is performed when setting HTTP or externally debugging sessions of other users. To debug a `<user_2>` session as a `<user_1>` user, the following conditions must be met:

- **User `<user_2>` Requirements:**
  - Must be a dialog user or a service user.
  - Must have debugging authorization, specifically the `S_DEVELOP` authorization object with:
    - `OBJTYPE`: `DEBUG`
    - `ACTVT`: `03`

- **User `<user_1>` Requirements:**
  - Must have authorization to debug another user's session.
  - Requires the `S_DEVELOP` authorization object with:
    - `OBJTYPE`: `DEBUG`
    - `ACTVT`: `90`
    - `OBJNAME`: `<user_2>`

The `SUSR_CHECK_DEBUG_ABILITY` function module can be used to verify if user `<user_1>` can execute a session of user `<user_2>` in the debugger.

### Solution
As a system administrator, create the necessary authorizations for HTTP/external debugging of other users and assign them to the appropriate user profiles. 

**Manual Implementation Steps:**
1. Start transaction `SU21` and double-click on the `BC_C` object class.
2. Select the `S_DEVELOP` authorization object.
3. Switch to change mode using the corresponding pushbutton.
4. In the maintenance dialog, use the 'allowed activities' pushbutton to select the `90 transfer` value.
5. Enter all relevant usernames in the "Object name" field and save the changes.
