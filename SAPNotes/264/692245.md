692245 - Additional server based security options for Scripting

## Symptom

The security switch described in [SAP Note 480149](https://me.sap.com/notes/480149) allows customers to enable or disable SAP GUI Scripting for an application server using a profile parameter. Many customers have asked for a more refined concept that allows them to enable certain features of SAP GUI Scripting while disabling others.

## Reason and Prerequisites

To utilize the enhanced security options for SAP GUI Scripting, the `sapgui/user_scripting` profile parameter must be enabled as described in [SAP Note 480149](https://me.sap.com/notes/480149). This parameter enables all SAP GUI Scripting features at once.

## Solution

In addition to the existing `sapgui/user_scripting` parameter, two new profile parameters have been introduced to provide more granular control over SAP GUI Scripting features:

### Disable Recording
- **Parameter:** `sapgui/user_scripting_disable_recording`
- **Description:** Setting this parameter to `TRUE` allows only script execution. SAP GUI will not send any scripting notifications to other applications, and user interactions cannot be recorded.

### Read Only
- **Parameter:** `sapgui/user_scripting_set_readonly`
- **Description:** In Read Only mode, only non-state-changing operations of the Scripting API are allowed. You can read properties and call read-only methods, but you cannot modify properties.
