**SAP Note 683528 - Security Enhancements for SAP MaxDB**

**Summary**
This security note provides crucial information regarding the secure operation of SAP DB/MaxDB and liveCache. It addresses vulnerabilities highlighted by various security entities and outlines the necessary steps to mitigate these risks.

**Symptom**
This note is correlated with Security Note 3855945. It outlines concerns related to buffer overflows, unauthorized access, and other security vulnerabilities that have been identified in SAP MaxDB.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
No specific prerequisites are mentioned. However, it's essential to ensure that your SAP systems are protected by firewalls and that MaxDB systems are only accessible from authorized application servers or administrators.

**Solution**
To address the security breaches identified in SAP MaxDB Version 7.x:

1. **Upgrade to Secure Versions**:
   - **7.5.00.44**

   - **7.6.01.11**
   - **7.6.02.04**
   - **7.6.03.01**

2. **Best Practices**:
   - Do not use a running SAP DB/MaxDB Web server to operate SAP Systems.
   - If web tools are necessary, run the Web server on a separate computer, not on the database server.
   - Consider using Apache for web server operations due to its enhanced security features.
