**Status:** Released for Customer

### Description

This security note addresses a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability where user entries are not properly encoded, allowing the injection and execution of malicious JavaScript in BSP pages. This can lead to unauthorized access to browser-managed cookies, which can be exploited to transfer cookie contents to another web page.

**Note:** This security note is obsolete and has been replaced by [SAP Notes 822881](https://me.sap.com/notes/822881) and [887168](https://me.sap.com/notes/887168).

### Affected Components

- **Component:** Business Server Pages (BC-BSP)
- **Software Components:** SAP_BASIS (from version 620 to 640)

### Solution

To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that all user inputs are properly HTML encoded before processing in ABAP. This prevents the execution of malicious scripts. Specific instructions include modifying the `ON_REQUEST` method of the `CL_BSP_RUNTIME` class to include form field encoding, as detailed in the note.
