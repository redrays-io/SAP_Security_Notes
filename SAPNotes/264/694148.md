### Symptom

The `RSSCAUTH` report, used to change the authorization group of a program, is insufficiently protected against uncontrolled execution. Currently, the system only checks if the user has an authorization (including the "SAP_ALL" value in the "Authorization group ABAP program" field) for the `S_PROGRAM` authorization object. This weak protection allows a large group of users to execute `RSSCAUTH`, which can have significant and unintended effects.

### Reason and Prerequisites

Both note 33154 and the report documentation provide detailed instructions on using `RSSCAUTH`. The authorization group of a program can also be maintained directly in the ABAP Editor's "Attributes" dialog box.

### Solution

To address the security vulnerability, import the specified Support Package or apply the note correction. This update enhances the security by tightening the conditions under which `RSSCAUTH` can be executed:

- **General Restriction:** Only users with at least display authorization for the `S_DEVELOP` authorization object can execute `RSSCAUTH`.
- **Authorization Checks:** If program attributes are changed during execution (not just in test mode), the same authorization checks that apply when making changes directly in the Object Navigator or ABAP Editor are enforced for each program.
- **Outcome of Failed Checks:** Any unsuccessful authorization check results in an immediate termination of `RSSCAUTH`, and the authorization group for the program remains unchanged.
