2546807 - List of Diagnostic Agents can't be retrieved due to enforced security at API level

**Symptom**

In the SAP Solution Manager configuration (transaction `SOLMAN_SETUP`), you notice the following symptoms, even though you previously discovered one or several Introscope Enterprise Managers successfully:

- In step 4 **Define CA Introscope**, under **Mandatory Configuration / Infrastructure Preparation**, the columns **Status** and **Capacity** remain completely empty.
- In step **Finalize Configuration**, under **Managed System Configuration**, the automatic activity **Introscope Host Adapter** fails with the error message:
  - On instance: ... Wily Agents could not be retrieved from EM for host ...! Reason: Cannot get list of all agents

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The SAP Solution Manager Java system doesn't retrieve the required information about the Introscope Enterprise Managers due to the enforced security checks at the API level.
