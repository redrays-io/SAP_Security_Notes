1676293 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in SRM-EBP

**Symptom**

SRM-EBP-CAT can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

Cross-site scripting, XSS, SRM-EBP-CAT, SICF Handler Classes

**Reason and Prerequisites**

SICF Handlers classes `CL_BBP_CT_XML_IMPORT`, `CL_BBP_CT_XML_IMPORT_CAT`, `CL_BBP_CT_XML_IMPORT_SCHEMA` within SRM-EBP-CAT do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting issue.

Cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.

If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
