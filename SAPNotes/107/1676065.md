1676065 - Assertion ticket is not evaluated correctly

**SAP Security Note 1676065 - Assertion ticket is not evaluated correctly**

**Symptom**
- The Web AS Java accepts assertion tickets issued for other systems.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
- Starting with the releases mentioned in this note, the Web AS Java will by default reject any assertion ticket that was not created specifically for itself, even if a valid trust relationship exists. This change enhances security by preventing potentially insecure assertion tickets from being accepted.

**Solution**
- **Update Web AS Java**: Apply the latest patch of the respective release as detailed in the "SP Patch Level" section of the note.
- **Upgrade the Stack**: Upgrade the entire stack to the latest Support Package available on the [SAP Service Marketplace](https://me.sap.com).

**UME Property Configuration**
- The new behavior is controlled by the UME property `login.assertion.ticket.validate_recipient`, which is set to `true` by default. This ensures that the Web AS Java rejects assertion tickets issued for other systems. It is strongly advised to keep this setting unchanged. However, if necessary, you can set it to `false` to revert to the old behavior.

**Support Package Patches**
Ensure you apply the relevant support package patches for your software component versions. You can find the patches [here](https://me.sap.com).

**Side Effects**
