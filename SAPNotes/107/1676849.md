1676849 - Unauthorized modification of BSP in CRM-MD-PRO-OBJ

**SAP Security Note 1676849 - Unauthorized Modification of BSP in CRM-MD-PRO-OBJ**

**Description:**

### Symptom
The Application Component **CRM-MD-PRO-OBJ** can be exploited by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability may allow the attacker to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- CRM-MD-PRO-OBJ

### Reason and Prerequisites
The BSP Page `COM_BSP_IO_MAP/iobject_location.htm` within the Application Component **CRM-MD-PRO-OBJ** does not sufficiently encode output parameters, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Exploiting this XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to:
- Steal authentication information, such as session data.
- Impersonate users, potentially gaining access with the same privileges.
- Compromise the security of the application, especially if an administrator is impersonated.
