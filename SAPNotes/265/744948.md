744948 - Security issue in the MSSQL DB interface

---

### **Symptom**
A security issue has been identified that could allow the unauthorized execution of arbitrary SQL commands in the SAP database. Only SAP systems running on Microsoft SQL Server are affected. A user must be logged on to the SAP system to exploit this vulnerability.

### **Other Terms**
- DBMSSSLIB.DLL
- MSSQL
- SQL Server database interface
- Security

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
Some ABAP code specific for MSSQL is not protected by the proper authority check. The code in question uses an undocumented feature in the database interface to execute SQL commands.

### **Solution**
SAP decided to fix the problem on kernel level rather than on ABAP level. Apply the latest DbSl patch for your R/3 basis release from the SAP Service Marketplace as soon as possible.

**The problem is fixed in the following patch levels:**

| **Basis release** | **Component** | **Patch level** |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| 3.1I              | dw            | 743              |
| 4.0B COM          | dw            | 1018             |
| 4.0B EXT          | dw            | 1019             |
| 4.5B              | lib_dbsl      | 927              |
