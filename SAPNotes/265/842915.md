842915 - Missing authorization check in transaction SUB%

**SAP Note Number:** 842915  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 4  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Release Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.10.2009  
**Component:** Basis Components > ABAP Runtime Environment - ABAP Language Issues Only > Syntax, Compiler, Runtime (BC-ABA-LA)  
**Category:** Program error  

### Description

#### Symptom

Any transactions can be started from transaction SUB% without the relevant transaction start authorization for each transaction being checked against `S_TCODE`.

Reports can also be started with transaction SUB%. However, an authorization check is always performed against `S_PROGRAM` for these reports, provided that the report in question is assigned to an authorization group.

#### Other Terms

Report SAPMSSYS, missing authorization check, authorization object `S_TCODE`, SAP shortcuts

#### Reason and Prerequisites

For technical reasons, transaction SUB% is required by certain functions of ABAP-based SAP systems (including SAP shortcuts) to start reports or transactions. However, transaction SUB% can also be started by users directly if their authorization (authorization object `S_TCODE`) permits this.

Due to a program error, there is no check in transaction SUB% to determine whether the user has the authorizations required to execute the transactions to be started.

#### Solution

Implement the corrections attached to this note or import the specified Support Packages.
