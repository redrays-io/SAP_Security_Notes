709054 - GW: Starting programs with log 'G'

## Symptom

An attempt to start a program on a remote host using the gateway (connection type 'G') fails.

## Other Terms

sec_info

## Reason and Prerequisites

Up to Release 4.5x, users had the option of using a gateway (connection type 'G') to start programs on remote hosts. For this purpose, a UDP package was sent to the gateway that started the program for RFC/CPIC communication.

This procedure involves risks because no checks can be carried out for the program to be started. For this reason, this start procedure was deactivated.

## Solution

Use a standalone gateway to start remote programs on systems on which no remote shell is available. You then have the option to check whether the program really can be started. For this, you must maintain the programs to be started in the `secinfo` file on the Gateway. For details, refer to the documentation.
