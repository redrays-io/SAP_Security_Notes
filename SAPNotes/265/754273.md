754273 - Availability of the system audit

**SAP Note Number**: 754273  
**Title**: Availability of the system audit  
**Type**: SAP Security Note  
**Category**: Advance development  
**Priority**: Correction with low priority  
**Status**: Released for Customer  
**Released On**: October 8, 2009  
**Component**: BC-SEC-AIS  

### Description
The system audit, which is part of the Audit Information System (AIS), was previously available only in the SAP_APPL (Logistics and Accounting) component. This note addresses the requirement to make the system audit available across all SAP systems (e.g., BW, CRM, SEM, APO) by relocating it to the SAP_BASIS component.

### Solution
To achieve the availability of the system audit in SAP_BASIS, the following steps are outlined:

1. **Support Packages**: Ensure that the necessary support packages are implemented in the SAP_BASIS component:
   - For SAP_BASIS 620: [SAPKB62043](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB62043) and [SAPKB62044](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB62044)
   - For SAP_BASIS 640: [SAPKB64005](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB64005) and [SAPKB64009](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB64009)

2. **Transaction and Authorization Roles**: Configure the required transaction and authorization roles using PFCG. Copy the roles into the customer namespace and assign them to users as needed.

3. **Modifying Roles**: If there are any extensions or reductions in transaction roles, corresponding modifications must be made to the authorization roles to ensure consistency and proper authorization.

4. **References to Documentation**: Set up references to necessary documentation using SAPscript, Knowledge Warehouse, SAP Library, IMG documentation, and web addresses.
