## Description

### Symptom
The composite SAP note provides various security-related information concerning the E-Recruiting component.

**Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Note 782567**: Prevents affected fields (e.g., input fields and TextEdit) from being output in the client (browser).
- **Note 736175**: Suppresses XSS during logon.
- **Note 737799**: Checks URL parameters for XSS.

**Protocol for Web Accesses: HTTPS**
- SAP recommends using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and HTTPS for E-Recruiting applications, especially when displaying personal information.

**Denial of Service**
- The number of accepted sessions can be configured with a profile parameter.
- HTTP connections to the WAS are limited to 200 via the `DISP/TM_MAX_NO` parameter.
- Increasing session limits shifts the problem to a higher threshold without a standard solution from SAP for public access scenarios.

**Information in Error Messages**
- Customizable display of information in error messages.
- Error pages can be redirected to a standard error page and adjusted customer-specifically.
- For more details, refer to SAP help pages: [SAP NetWeaver Documentation](https://me.sap.com/help.sap.com/)

**Internet Communication Management Framework**
- Activate only necessary ICF services for application access.
- **Note 626073**: Lists services not required in production for SAP E-Recruiting.

**Authorization Check for Documents in Knowledge Provider (KPRO)**
- Access to attachments is secured via a digitally signed key and recommended to be encrypted using SSL.
- Access URLs are time-bound and must be known to the user to prevent unauthorized access.
