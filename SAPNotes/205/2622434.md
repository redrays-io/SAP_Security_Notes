**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 10.07.2018  
**Component:** Basis Components > Client/Server Technology > Network Interface  

**Symptom:**  
Under certain conditions, SAProuter allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted. Specifically, SAProuter forwards its own password in the route string to the next SAProuter, increasing the risk of password disclosure. This information could be used by an attacker to specialize attacks against an SAProuter and targets behind it.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**  
Due to a program error, SAProuter forwards its own password in the route string to the next SAProuter.

**Solution:**  
This SAP Note removes SAProuter's password from the route string that is forwarded to the next SAProuter.
