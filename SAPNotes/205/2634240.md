**Description**

### Symptom

SAP CRM WebClient UI does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Some well-known impacts of XSS vulnerability are:

- Non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website
- Steal authentication information of the user, such as data relating to their current session
- Impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user
- Unauthorized execution of commands

### Other Terms

XSS, stored XSS, reflected XSS, CSS

### Reason and Prerequisites

CRM WebClient UI does not encode or validate untrusted input. The attacker needs to trick an already authenticated user into visiting a prepared website to launch the attack.

### Solution

Input encoding and validation have been added.

Please implement the solution below or install the equivalent Support Package.
