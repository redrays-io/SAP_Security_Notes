2633366 - Denial of service (DOS) in iXML Toolset of SAP Kernel

### Description
**Symptom**
The iXML Toolset of SAP Kernel allows an attacker to prevent legitimate users from accessing a service by either crashing or flooding the service.

**Impacts of Denial of Service Vulnerability:**
- Long response delays and service interruptions, degrading the service quality for legitimate users.
- Direct impact on availability.

**Other Terms**
DoS, DDoS, Distributed Denial of Service, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, Resource Exhaustion.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
This issue occurs only in SAP Kernel 7.53 used in ABAP Server 7.52.

**Solution**
The handling of endless loops has been hardened. The correction is part of the SAP Kernel. With the correction installed, the iXML parser will raise the parse error: unexpected symbol: '#'.
