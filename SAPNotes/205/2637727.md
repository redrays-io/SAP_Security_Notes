### **Description**

#### Symptom
SAP Bank Account Management (BAM) allows an authenticated user with restricted access to use functions, which can result in escalation of privileges with low impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.

#### Other Terms
- Authorization
- Escalated privileges
- BAM
- Missing Authorization
- [CVE-2024-24739](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24739)

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Access to data via the Virtual Data Model (VDM) with Core Data Services (CDS) should be controlled by a combination of a start authorization check of the consumption domain (e.g., Analytics) and an instance-based authorization for the data source CDS view.

It has been identified that the instance-based authorization for these data source CDS Views is currently missing, and an appropriate solution is provided as part of this SAP Security Note.

#### Solution
Relevant authorization checks have been introduced via DCL to avoid unauthorized access. Implement the Correction Instructions or Support Packages referenced by this SAP Security Note.
