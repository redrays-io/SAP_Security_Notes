1936898 - CRM Mobile Client: Security Fixes

**SAP Note Number:** 1936898  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 14.10.2014  
**Component:** CRM-MT (Customer Relationship Management > Mobile Technology)

### Symptom

- **Malicious File Upload:** Possible to upload malicious files or scripts through the Mobile Client, which are then saved in the central database and accessible to other Mobile Clients.
- **Data Exposure on Shared Systems:** On a shared laptop with multiple users, personalization and history data of any user can be accessed by all.
- **Plain Text Passwords:** Database passwords are stored as plain text strings in the registry.
- **Reversible Password Encryption:** Reversible password encryption is used for the Mobile clients.

### Reason and Prerequisites

1. **Virus Scan Failure:** Failing to perform virus scan checks allows the possibility to upload malicious files onto the server, which can be executed on different systems when retrieved later.
2. **Shared System Vulnerability:** When the system is shared by several users, it's possible to access history data of other users, revealing user-specific information/configuration. An attacker must be on the same system or network to exploit this.
3. **Insecure Password Storage:** Storing passwords in plain text allows users or other applications to access and misuse them.
4. **Weak Encryption Practices:** Passwords should be stored using irreversible encryption to prevent decryption by illegitimate users.

**Prerequisite Mobile Client Versions:**
- CRM Mobile 5.0 SP10 to SP13, and SP15
- CRM Mobile 6.0 SP02, 6.0 SP06, and 6.0 SP08
- CRM Mobile 7.0 SP01, 7.0 SP04, and 7.0 SP08
- CRM Mobile 7.01 SP01 and 7.01 SP05

### Solution

This patch addresses the following issues:

- **File Permissions and Access Control:** Fixed weak file permissions and access issues in the Mobile installation directory. Restricted access to personalized data like Favorites, History, Personalization, and Field History specific to each CRM Mobile User.
- **Enhanced Security Checks:** Implemented virus checks and file type checks to ensure only valid file types are uploaded and viewed.
- **Improved Authentication and Encryption:** Strengthened login authentication and password encryption mechanisms to enhance security.
