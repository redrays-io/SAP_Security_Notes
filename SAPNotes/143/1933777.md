**SAP Note Number:** 1933777  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Category:** Program Error  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 29.04.2014  

### Description

**Symptom**  
An authenticated user can use functions of XX-CSC-RU-FI to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
XX-CSC-RU-FI does not contain required checks against a positive set of allowed functions (i.e., whitelist) during the execution of these functions. This is necessary to verify that authenticated users are permitted to access these functions. The missing check may lead to undesired system behavior.

**Solution**  
Implement the support package or apply the correction instructions provided in this note.  
No additional manual activities are required to maintain the whitelist.
