SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment.

**Other Terms**

Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS of LCM

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Only SBOP 4.0 SP1 and SP2 are affected. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

BI4 customers should install BI4 SP3 or higher.

BI4 Edge customers should install BI Edge 4.1.
