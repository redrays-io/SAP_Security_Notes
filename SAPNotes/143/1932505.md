1932505 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in NWBC

**SAP Security Note 1932505: Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in NWBC**

**Description**

**Symptom**

An attacker can abuse NWBC (NetWeaver Business Client) to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability may allow the extraction of authentication information from legitimate users, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. It does not account for specific system configurations or environments.*

**Affected Components**

- **SAP_UI** versions 740
- **SAP_BASIS** versions 700 to 740

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The vulnerability arises because test page web services within NWBC do not sufficiently encode input parameters. This lack of proper encoding results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can non-permanently deface or modify web content and potentially steal users' authentication information, leading to impersonation and unauthorized access.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability, **implement SAP Security Note 1932505**. Applying this note will address the reflected XSS issue by ensuring proper encoding of input parameters in NWBC.
