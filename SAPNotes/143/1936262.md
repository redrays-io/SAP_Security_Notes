1936262 - Directory Traversal in ASU Toolbox

**SAP Security Note 1936262** addresses a directory traversal vulnerability in the ASU Toolbox component of SAP Solution Manager. This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files on the remote server, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information.

### Symptom
ASU Toolbox fails to properly validate file paths used to reference files on the remote server. This flaw enables an attacker to direct the program to access arbitrary files within the system, potentially exposing their contents.

### Solution
To mitigate this vulnerability, refer to **[Security Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003)** for more information. Implementing the corrections described in this note is a prerequisite for applying SAP Security Note 1936262.

You can apply the necessary corrections by:
- Implementing the corrections as an advance correction.
- Importing the associated Support Package from **[ST-PI 2008_1](https://me.sap.com/support_package/ST-PI_2008_1)**.

For manual implementation:
1. Use transaction `FILE` to create the logical file path `ASU_TOOLBOX_UPGRADE_PATH` with the name "ASU Toolbox Upgrade Path."
2. Create the required logical file names as specified in the note.
3. Implement the attached program corrections.

**Note:** Ensure that the logical path is correctly assigned to the physical path on your system to activate the directory traversal check.
