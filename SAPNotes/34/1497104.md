## SAP Security Note 1497104 - Protect access to PSE files by additional AUTHORITY-CHECK

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** HotNews  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 14.09.2010  
**Component:** Secure Store and Forward (BC-SEC-SSF)  
**Version:** 6  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Recency:** New  

### Description

Insufficient authorization checks may allow ABAP programs to access PSE files.

**Other Terms:** STRUST, public key, PSE, Personal Security Environment

### Solution

Install the relevant kernel patch for your SAP release:

- **Kernel 4.0B PL #1075** (or higher)
- **Kernel 4.5B PL #1006** (or higher)
- **Kernel 4.6D PL #2540** (or higher)
- **Kernel 6.40 PL #342** (or higher)
- **Kernel 7.00 PL #268** (or higher)
- **Kernel 7.01 PL #106** (or higher)
- **Kernel 7.10 PL #212** (or higher)
- **Kernel 7.11 PL #098** (or higher)
- **Kernel 7.20 PL #061** (or higher)

After applying the correction, the system will allow access to PSE files (i.e., files ending with `.pse`) and the file `cred_v2` only after a successful authorization check for the object `S_RZL_ADM` with the field `ACTVT` and value `01`, in addition to the `S_DATASET` and `S_PATH` authorization checks. These authorizations are included in the authorization proposals (see transaction SU24) for transaction STRUST.
