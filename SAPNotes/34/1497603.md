### Description
**Symptom**  
The BSP-Application: PROVDLNV, BSP-Page: MainViewSet.htm could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**  
Cross-Site Scripting

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
Program error  
BSP-Application: PROVDLNV, BSP-Page: MainViewSet.htm does not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data could use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the application's security could be fully compromised.

### Solution
The cross-site scripting related code has been removed from the page.
