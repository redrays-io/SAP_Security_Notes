1497170 - Directory Traversal in Archivelink function modules

**SAP Security Note 1497170** addresses a critical directory traversal vulnerability in Archivelink function modules. This vulnerability allows malicious users to write arbitrary files on the remote server, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized alteration of system behavior.

### **Symptom**
Several Archivelink Function Modules are susceptible to directory traversal attacks. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can write arbitrary files to the remote server, compromising data integrity and system functionality.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The affected function modules fail to properly validate the path where user-submitted files are written. This lack of validation enables attackers to overwrite existing data on the remote system.

**Prerequisite:** Implementation of [SAP Security Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) is required before applying this note.
