SAP Security Note 1496919 - Executing any source code and unauthorized change...

### Description
- **Symptom:**
  1. A malicious user may be able to execute any source code.
  2. A malicious user could modify displayed application content without authorization, save the modified data, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

- **Other Terms:**
  BRF, Business Rule Framework, code injection, backdoor, cross-site scripting, XSS

- **Reason and Prerequisites:**
  - The program code allows defining and executing user-supplied code, altering system behavior. Valid logon information is required, but the source code items are not accessible in the standard SAP system as they are experimental.
  - A Business Server Page within the Business Rule Framework does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a permanent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows malicious users to store and execute scripts, potentially compromising user data and system security.

### Affected Components and Versions
- **SAP_BASIS:** 710 to 730
- **SAP_ABA:** 640 to 702
- **ABA_PLUS:** 100

### Solution
The affected parts of the source code have been completely retired by inserting `ASSERT` statements and commenting out problematic sections to eliminate the risk of an attack. This includes removing the experimental Business Server Page used in the Business Rule Framework.

**Immediate Actions:**
- Refer to the [automatic and manual correction instructions](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001496919/41) provided in the note.
