**SAP Security Note 1496707 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in PLM-CFO**

**Summary**

SAP Security Note 1496707 addresses a vulnerability in the PLM-CFO component that allows unauthorized modification of displayed application content through reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS). This can lead to the theft of user authentication information and potential impersonation of users, including administrators.

**Symptom**

The PLM-CFO can be abused by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

_For more detailed information, see Security Notes [1593294](https://me.sap.com/notes/1593294) and [1613163](https://me.sap.com/notes/1613163)._

**Other Terms**

- Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
- cFolder
- PLM-CFO

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages within the PLM-CFO do not sufficiently encode input and output parameters, resulting in a reflected XSS issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Additionally, reflected XSS can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. In the case of an administrator being impersonated, a full compromise of the application's security may occur.
