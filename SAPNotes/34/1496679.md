1496679 - Unauthorized modification of content in IC Context area code

**Description**

This SAP Security Note addresses a critical vulnerability in the Interaction Center (IC) Context Area of the CRM-IC-FRW component. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to modify displayed application content without authorization, potentially gaining access to authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Symptom**

The IC Context Area can be abused by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization. This could allow an attacker to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

- Local Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- IC Context Area

**Reason and Prerequisites**

HTM pages in the BSP Application `CRMCMP_IC_FRAME` do not sufficiently encode parameters, resulting in a Local Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. This vulnerability allows attackers to modify displayed content on a website. Parameters passed to a web page are processed and embedded into the page on the client via JavaScript. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could impersonate users and access information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the applicationâ€™s security could be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Apply the correction instructions provided in this note to mitigate the vulnerability. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001496679/63).
