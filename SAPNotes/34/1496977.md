1496977 - Missing Authorization Check in REPORT

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use functionality of the BOR object REPORT to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an escalation of privileges.

**Other Terms**

Authorization, authorization check, SWO1

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The BOR object REPORT lacks permission checks for an authenticated userâ€™s authorization to access some of its functionality. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

Import the appropriate Support Package or implement the correction instructions. After applying the fix, the authorization object `S_DEVELOP` will be checked in the BOR object REPORT.

**Correction Instructions**

If implementing via correction instructions, the following manual activities are required:

1. **Create the T100 Message WO 814**
   - Use transaction `SE91`.
   - Message short text: *No change authorization (&) for program &*.
   - The message is self-explanatory.
   - Save the message.

2. **Add Exception 1001 to the BOR Object REPORT**
   - Use transaction `SWO1`.
   - Navigate to the method `EDIT` of the BOR object REPORT.
   - Add exception number: `1001`.
   - Error type: *Application error*.
   - Message: *Application Area WO, Message 814*.
   - Save and generate the BOR object.
