This vulnerability allows unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information within the Supplier Factsheet and Enterprise Search for Business Partner, Supplier, and Customer applications, potentially compromising confidentiality.

**Symptom**
Unauthenticated users may access private address and bank details of Employee Business Partners with Supplier Roles through the Supplier Factsheet app. Additionally, Enterprise Search for Customer, Supplier, and Business Partner objects exposes private address fields without proper authorization checks.

- **Versions:** 104, 105, 106
- **SAP Components:** LO-MD-BP (Logistics - Basic Data - Business Partners)

**Solution**
Implement Security Note **3142092** to mitigate the vulnerability. The note includes:
1. Addition of B_BUPA_ADR and B_BUPA_BNK authority checks in the Supplier Factsheet application.
2. Removal of address fields from Enterprise Search results due to framework limitations preventing control via authority objects.

**Additional Information**

- **Priority:** Correction with medium priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer
