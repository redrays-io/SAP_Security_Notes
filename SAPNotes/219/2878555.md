### Description
In SAP Business Objects Business Intelligence Platform, certain dynamic pages (like JSP) are improperly cached. As a result, even after logging out, an attacker can access sensitive information via the cache and reopen these dynamic pages. This update addresses additional JSP pages that were previously not covered.

**Other Terms:**  
- Improper session management  
- Cache management
