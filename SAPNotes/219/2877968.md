**SAP Note:** 2877968 - [CVE-2020-6192] Missing Input Validation in SAP Landscape Management

**Description:**

An attacker with admin privileges could execute malicious commands with root privileges in SAP Host Agent via SAP Landscape Management due to missing input validation.

**CVE:** [CVE-2020-6192](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6192)

**CVSS Score:** 7.2  
**CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`

**Affected Components:**
- SAP Landscape Management
- SAP Host Agent

**Prerequisites:**
1. Authentication as a user in the `admin_group` against the SAP Host Agent (via SOAP/remotely).
2. SAP Landscape Management installed with at least one managed host configured.

**Solution:**

1. **Install [SAP Landscape Management 3.0 SP13 Patch 3](https://me.sap.com/notes/2887591).**
2. **Install the [SAP Adaptive Extensions Patch 52](https://me.sap.com/notes/1808793)** on all managed hosts where SAP Adaptive Extensions have been installed before (e.g., SAP HANA hosts, appliance provisioning).
3. **Execute a mass validation** on all hosts of your landscape for validator `RuntimeInternalOperationValidator` to activate the fixes immediately. If not executed manually, fixes will be enabled with the next automatic execution of the validation (24h by default). For more information, see [Validating Hosts](https://help.sap.com/viewer/e7dead4286c545808b3bd24feee7448c/latest/en-US/f19736626215495e8675fb4d07f81a23.html).

**Additional Information:**

If the `operations.d` directory of your managed hosts is mounted, update `*.conf` files from SAP Adaptive Extensions Patch 52 as per [SAP Note 1550099](https://me.sap.com/notes/1550099).

**Installation Order:**

Ensure you install SAP Landscape Management 3.0 SP13 Patch 3 before installing SAP Adaptive Extensions Patch 52.
