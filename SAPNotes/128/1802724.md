## Description

### Symptom

**This security note replaces security note 1800926**

BW-BEX-ET-WJR-RT can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

The issue does not occur in releases ≥ 7.3x. In those releases, the requests are blocked by NetWeaver portal infrastructure. Nevertheless, the correction in BI Java was introduced also in those releases to ensure the highest security.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score**: 4.3
- **CVSS Vector**: AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/) at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Reason and Prerequisites

Interfaces within BW-BEX-ET-WJR do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
