1812645 - Missing authorization check in JIT

---

**SAP Security Note 1812645** addresses a critical vulnerability in the Just-In-Time (JIT) component where proper authorization checks are absent. This oversight allows authenticated users to access restricted functions, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

### Symptom
An authenticated user can utilize JIT functions without appropriate authorization, resulting in possible escalation of privileges.

### CVSS Information
- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.9
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:N/I:P/A:P

### Reason and Prerequisites
The JIT component does not perform necessary authorization checks to verify if an authenticated user has the permissions required to access certain functions. This lack of verification can lead to unintended system behavior and potential security breaches.

### Solution
Implement the corrections provided in the SAP Security Note to enforce proper authorization checks within the JIT component.

### Affected Software Components
- **Component:** ECC-DIMP
- **Versions:** 500 to 617
