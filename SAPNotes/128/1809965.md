SAP Security Note 1809965 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in Logon App

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** August 13, 2013  
**Component:** Basis Components > NetWeaver Application Server Java > Security, User Management  
**Language:** English

### Symptom

SAP Logon Application can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### CVSS Information

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3  
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Other Terms

- Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, SAP Logon Application

### Reason and Prerequisites

The logon page within Logon Application does not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution

The issue is reproducible with Internet Explorer; using Firefox prevents the issue.

To apply the fix, you need to deploy the necessary components according to the Validity and Support Package Patch Level sections of this note.
