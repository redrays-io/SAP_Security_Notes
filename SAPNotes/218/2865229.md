2865229 - [CVE-2020-6283] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SAP Fiori Launchpad

**Description**

**Symptom**

SAP Fiori Launchpad does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, allowing an attacker to inject meta tags into the launchpad HTML using a vulnerable parameter. This results in a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. With a successful attack, the attacker can steal authentication information of the user, such as data related to the current session.

**Other Terms**
- XSS
- Reflected XSS
- CSS
- [CVE-2020-6283](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6283)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Some parameters are not properly validated, which leads to the vulnerability. The attacker needs to trick an already authenticated user into visiting a prepared website to execute the attack.

**Solution**

The untrusted input is now validated, and execution is prohibited. The correction is available in the following SAPUI5 versions:

- **1.38.38**
- **1.52.38**
- **1.60.25**
- **1.71.18**
