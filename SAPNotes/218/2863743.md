A critical SAP Security Note addressing a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Rest Adapter of SAP Process Integration (CVE-2020-6305).

### **Symptom**
The Rest Adapter in SAP Process Integration does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, leading to an XSS vulnerability. Potential impacts include:
- Defacing or modifying displayed content on a website.
