2857511 - [CVE-2020-6188] Missing Authorization check in SAP ERP and S/4 HANA (VAT Pro-Rata reports)

## Symptom

VAT Pro-Rata reports do not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user.

**Some well-known impacts of Missing Authorization check are:**

- Abuse functionality restricted to a particular user group
- Read, modify, or delete restricted data

## Reason and Prerequisites

The report is executed in Update Run mode. Other execution modes are not affected.

## Solution

The affected functions have now been enforced to properly check the access restrictions.

**Important:** It is assumed that the user profiles for these functions already contain the authorization for object `F_BKPF_BUK` for `ACTVT 01`. If not, this must be added to the users' authorizations.

As a general rule, SAP recommends that you install a solution by applying a Support Package. However, if you need to install this solution earlier, use the Note Assistant to implement the correction instruction. You can find more information about the Note Assistant in SAP Service Marketplace, under [service.sap.com/note-assistant](https://me.sap.com/note-assistant).
