1660718 - Cross site scripting vulnerability in BSP pages for AMC

**Symptom**
AMC versions 2.0-4.0 can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, AMC 4.0

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Pages within AMC do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.  
Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**
This fix is included in the standard release of the applet starting with version 2.0. Please use the standard procedure to install it.
