### **Symptom**
An authenticated user assigned to the role `SAP_XI_APPL_SERV_USER` can use functions of PI Integration Directory or PI Enterprise Services Repository to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### **Other Terms**
Authorization, authorization check, Process Integration, Advanced Adapter Engine Extended, Process Integration and Orchestration Package

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
PI Integration Directory and Enterprise Services Repository do not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access certain functions. This may lead to undesired system behavior.

### **Solution**
We have changed the rights of the role `SAP_XI_APPL_SERV_USER` to protect the mentioned applications. Users with this role can no longer use functions to which they shouldn't have access.

**Update Instructions:**
- **Patch Levels:** Please update the software components of the Adapter Engine to the patch levels maintained in the "SP Patch Level" section of this note or use newer versions.
- **Resources:** The archives and the support package stack guide can be found on the [SAP Service Marketplace](https://me.sap.com/) as described in [SAP Note 952402](https://me.sap.com/notes/952402).
