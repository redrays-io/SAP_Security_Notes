---

### Header Data
- **SAP Note/KBA:** 3472837
- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Version:** 11
- **Recency:** New
- **Language:** English
- **Master Language:** English
- **Category:** Program error
- **Priority:** Correction with medium priority
- **Release Status:** Released for Customer
- **Released On:** 14.01.2025
- **Component:** SAP GUI for Windows (BC-FES-GUI)

### Description
#### Symptom
SAP GUI for Windows stores user input on the client PC to improve usability. Under very specific circumstances, an attacker with administrative privileges or access to the victimâ€™s user directory at the Operating System level could read this data. Depending on the user input in transactions, the disclosed data could range from non-critical to highly sensitive, impacting the confidentiality of the application.

#### Other Terms
Information Exposure, Information Leak, [CVE-2025-0055](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0055)

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Accessing the input history requires strong authorizations on the client PC/server the attacked user is using. Typically, administrative rights are needed, or the user must be tricked into providing access. Additionally, input history is only stored if not deactivated by the application.

#### Solution
The issue is fixed by the SAP GUI for Windows patch mentioned in this security note. Install this patch or a newer one, as SAP GUI patches are cumulative.

The correction enhances security by using a stronger encryption method provided by the operating system. If this method fails or is unavailable, the previous encryption method is applied. If both fail, input history is completely disabled to eliminate risk. No obfuscation is used anymore, unlike in previous SAP GUI for Windows versions.

**Emergency Measure:**
If obfuscation must be retained when both encryptions fail, set the `HistoryIgnoreDisabledEncryption` registry value to `1` (default is `0 = OFF`).

- **64-bit SAP GUI for Windows:**
  ```
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SAP\SAPGUI Front\SAP Frontend Server\LocalData
  ```
- **32-bit SAP GUI for Windows:**
  ```
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\(WOW6432Node)\SAP\SAPGUI Front\SAP Frontend Server\LocalData
  ```
