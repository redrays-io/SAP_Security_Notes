3478615 - [CVE-2024-37179] Insecure File Operations vulnerability in SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (Web Intelligence)

## Symptom

SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform allows an authenticated user to send a specially crafted request to the Web Intelligence Reporting Server to download any file from the machine hosting the service, causing high impact on confidentiality of the application.

## Other Terms

- Unrestricted File Upload
- Malicious File Execution
- [CVE-2024-37179](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37179)

## Reason and Prerequisites

The personal data provider feature did not have any restriction on the directories from which data was fetched.

## Solution

After the patch is installed, to restrict access to personal data providers, create a file **PersonalFile_AllowList.txt** in the following folder:

- **Windows:** `$InstallDir\SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise XI 4.0\win64_x64\config`
- **Linux:** `$InstallDir/sap_bobj/enterprise_xi40/linux_x64/config`

The file must contain the list of folders that can contain personal data providers. There must be one folder per line.
