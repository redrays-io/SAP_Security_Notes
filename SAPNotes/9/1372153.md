SAP Security Note 1372153 - Security Patch for ECL Viewer

**Symptom**

ECL Viewer is a front-end component integrated with SAP GUI used to display 2D and 3D files such as `.jpg` and `.jt`. The DLLs `Webviewer2D.dll` and `Webviewer3D.dll` included with ECL Viewer contain insecure methods that can overwrite any file in the system. An attacker can create HTML pages that call these vulnerable functions in the DLLs, leading to serious security threats.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Having ECL Viewer on the frontend is sufficient to be vulnerable to security attacks. This vulnerability was identified after the installation of patch 1 of ECL Viewer.

**Solution**

- **Apply Patch 3:** Install patch 3 of ECL Viewer 6.0 from [SAP Note 1334302](https://me.sap.com/notes/1334302). Installing this fix will not affect backend functionality.
- **Set Kill Bits:** Configure kill bits for the entire SAPGUI as per [SAP Note 1092631](https://me.sap.com/notes/1092631) to reduce the chances of an attack.
