- **Recency:** Updated
- **Language:** English
- **Category:** Program error
- **Priority:** Correction with medium priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer
- **Released On:** 09.12.2009
- **Component:** Customer Relationship Management > Billing > Billing Engine Framework

### Description

#### Symptom
The program `BEFG_TEMPLATE_CREATE` can be used to modify a standard template of the Billing Engine Framework in the production system. Authorization checks are not performed before executing this program. Although a potential attacker must be able to transport modifications into the system before executing the program `BEFG_TEMPLATE_CREATE`, user input is not accepted directly.

Thus, the potential risk exists that the business behavior of the billing application is influenced in the production system.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The program was developed as part of the Billing Engine Framework to assist developers in converting function modules or programs into templates. These templates cannot be executed in any system but serve as the basis for the Framework to generate the corresponding objects of the Billing Engine Application, which could be either a function module or a program.

The potential security issue arises if the program is executed in the production system and modifies the template of an existing object of the Billing application. Therefore, a function module or program must be part of the production environment to be used as the source for the template information.

If a user has the permission to regenerate the billing application (which requires the authorization object BEF_META), the programs of the productive Billing application can be altered as well.

#### Solution
Enhancements have been made to the program `BEFG_TEMPLATE_CREATE` to ensure it cannot be executed in a production system. Additionally, the corresponding permissions of the authorization object BEF_META are now checked.
