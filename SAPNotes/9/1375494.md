1375494 - SAP system does not start after applying SAP kernel patch

**Symptom**

Due to severe security issues with the Microsoft ATL, Windows Server customers must apply a runtime fix detailed in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS09-035.mspx). After applying a new SAP kernel patch, you might encounter one of the following issues:

- **SAP System Fails to Start:** Your SAP system fails to start after applying a new SAP kernel patch downloaded from the SAP Service Marketplace. To determine if you are affected, refer to the "Detecting whether SAP will not start up due to missing MS patch" section in the attached PDF document.
  
- **Future Downloads May Fail:** Your SAP system runs fine, but without applying the Microsoft security fix mentioned above, future downloads of SAP binaries from the SAP Service Marketplace might not work, depending on your release and kernel version.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

- **Affected Systems:** Running an SAP system on Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008 without the MS security patch can prevent the SAP system from starting after applying kernel patches.
  
- **Kernel Versions:** Systems with kernel version 7.01 and higher or those using the EX2 kernel are particularly affected. Even older kernels without the EX2 kernel require the MS security patch to mitigate severe security risks.
