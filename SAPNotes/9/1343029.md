### Description

#### Symptom
The shopping cart basic data screen can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, shopping cart

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The basic item data screen within the shopping cart does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

#### Solution
This note will fix the vulnerability of allowing code injection by malicious web users into the web pages viewed by other users, thereby preventing the transfer of critical information.
