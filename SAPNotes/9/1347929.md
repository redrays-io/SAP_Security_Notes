1347929 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in SHP

## SAP Security Note 1347929

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 7  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** December 14, 2010  
**Component:** Supplier Relationship Management > SRM > Technical Issues > ITS and Web files

### Symptom
The Shopping cart fields could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

This vulnerability allows for code injection by malicious web users into the web pages viewed by other users, thereby preventing the transfer of critical information.

### Other Terms
- BBPSC01, BBPSC02
- XSS, cross-site scripting
- SRM, Supplier Relationship Management
- E-Commerce, Web, business-to-business
- SAP Business-to-Business Procurement BBP
- Enterprise Buyer professional edition
- Supplier Self Service

### Reason and Prerequisites
This issue is caused by a program error where fields that can contain special characters were not correctly masked. Specifically, the shopping cart history page does not sufficiently encode input/output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. 

A reflected XSS attack can be used to:
- Non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a website.
- Steal another user's authentication information, such as session data.
- Impersonate users, including administrators, potentially compromising application security entirely.

**Affected Releases:**
- SAP SRM 5.0
