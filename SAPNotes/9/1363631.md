New SAP Security Note 1363631: BADI BUPA_F4_AUGRP does not filter BP's in search

**SAP Security Note 1363631 - BADI BUPA_F4_AUGRP does not filter BP's in search**

- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Version:** 5
- **Priority:** HotNews
- **Status:** Released for Customer
- **Released On:** 17.02.2011
- **Component:** Application Platform > Master Data > Business Partner (`AP-MD-BP`)
- **Language:** English

### Symptom
The search help feature displayed Business Partner details even when the user lacked the necessary authorization. This allows users without sufficient permissions to view Business Partner data through the search help, which is unintended behavior.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The issue occurs if the authorization role does not include the `B_BUPA_GRP` object. The code responsible for filtering Business Partners in the search results relies on this authorization object. If it's missing, the BADI implementation `BUPA_F4_AUGRP` fails to filter the Business Partners appropriately.

### Solution
Implement the solution provided in this SAP Note to ensure that Business Partners are correctly filtered based on user authorizations.
