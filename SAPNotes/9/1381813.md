SAP Note 1381813 - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035 - SAP GUI for Windows

**SAP Note 1381813 - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035 - SAP GUI for Windows**

**Symptom**
Due to serious security issues with the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL), users of SAP GUI for Windows must apply the corrections provided in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-035.mspx).

Since SAP GUI for Windows utilizes controls created with ATL, it's essential to update SAP GUI to resolve these security vulnerabilities. For more information, refer to [Note 1375494](https://me.sap.com/notes/1375494) which discusses related issues in the SAP kernel environment.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The problem is caused by a program error in the Microsoft ATL. No correction exists for SAP GUI for Windows 6.20, as it was built using Visual Studio 98, which is no longer supported by Microsoft. Therefore, it is recommended to urgently upgrade to SAP GUI for Windows 7.10 or a higher release.

**Solution**
The issue is corrected by applying an SAP GUI for Windows patch. SAP GUI patches are cumulative; installing the appropriate patch level will address the security concern.
