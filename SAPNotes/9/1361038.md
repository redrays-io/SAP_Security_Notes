SAP Security Note 1361038 - Report RJ-JXINI Generates Unnecessary Source Code

**SAP Note Number:** 1361038  
**Title:** Report RJ-JXINI generates unnecessary source code  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 4  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 14.04.2010  
**Component:** IS-M (Industry-Specific Components > Media)  
**Category:** Program error  

### Symptom
The report **RJ-JXINI** reads the field **GSTRU** from the Customizing table **TMC4** and expects the name of a table in this field. It uses this information to generate a second report that deletes all contents of the specified table as an initialization step. If **TMC4-GSTRU** contains additional SQL statements beyond the table name, unexpected actions may be performed in the database.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The report **RJ-JXINI** unnecessarily generates and executes ABAP source code through dynamic ABAP statements. This poses a risk if users have **IS-Media-specific** authorizations and access to the **TMC4** table. To execute **RJ-JXINI**, a user requires authorization for the authorization object **S_PROGRAM** (authorization group **JVISLONE**) and **M_NEUA_AUS** (application **J1**).

### Solution
Implement the corrections specified in the correction instructions provided in SAP Note 1361038. The report **RJ-JXINI** will be modified to use dynamic database statements instead of generating ABAP source code, thereby preventing unintentional database actions due to incorrect entries in **TMC4-GSTRU**.

### Affected Software Components
- **IS-M** versions from 3.04 to 604
