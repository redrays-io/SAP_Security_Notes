### Symptom

Under certain conditions, the memory of *SAP GUI for Windows* contains the password used to log on to an SAP system, which might allow an attacker to obtain the password and impersonate the affected user. This issue has a high impact on confidentiality but does not affect integrity or availability.

### Other Terms

Information Exposure, Information Leak, SAP GUI, [CVE-2024-39600](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39600)

### Reason and Prerequisites

The password can only be obtained under special conditions and only if the attacker has full access to the process memory of the SAP GUI for Windows process running within the attacked user's profile. This requires extensive authorizations on the client PC, which can already indicate a compromised system.

### Solution

**General Recommendation**

Avoid the issue by using a software component that enables single sign-on for SAP GUI for Windows. Providing passwords in clear text always poses a risk, especially when passwords are transferred via the Windows clipboard, which also maintains a history of copied items.

**Detailed Solution**

Implement the Support Packages and Patches referenced by this SAP Note.

**Downloading SAP GUI Patches**

All SAP GUI patches are available on the [SAP Support Portal](https://me.sap.com/). Detailed information about the location of the patches can be found in [SAP Note 563161](https://me.sap.com/notes/563161).
