     **Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17495)

2. **Remote Code Execution (CVE-2022-36364)**
   - **Details:** Due to improper initialization, the Apache Calcite Avatica JDBC driver in SAP CX Commerce is vulnerable to remote code execution. The driver does not verify if the class implements the expected interface before instantiating it, allowing arbitrary code execution.
