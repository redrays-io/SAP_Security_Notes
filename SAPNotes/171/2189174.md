SAP Security Note 2189174 - Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in Message Server

**Overview**

SAP Security Note [2189174](https://me.sap.com/notes/2189174) addresses a critical vulnerability in the message server that can be exploited through reflected cross-site scripting (XSS). This vulnerability allows attackers to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially steal authentication information from legitimate users.

**Symptom**

An attacker can abuse the message server to:
- Modify displayed application content without authorization.
- Obtain authentication information from other legitimate users, potentially leading to session hijacking and impersonation.

**Affected Components**

- **Software Components:** 
  - KRNL32NUC
  - KRNL32UC
  - KRNL64NUC
  - KRNL64UC
  - KERNEL
- **Versions Affected:** Various versions across 7.21, 7.22, 7.41, 7.42, 7.43, 7.44, and 7.45 for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

**Prerequisites**

- An HTTP or HTTPS port must be configured for the message server.
- Within HTTP(S) message processing, the message server must not sufficiently encode output parameters, leading to the XSS issue.

**Solution**

Apply the kernel patch level specified in SAP Security Note [2189174](https://me.sap.com/notes/2189174). Ensure that your system is updated to at least the recommended patch levels to mitigate the vulnerability.
