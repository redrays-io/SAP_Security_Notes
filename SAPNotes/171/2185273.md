2185273 - Missing authorization check in the monitor for real-time data acquisition (RDA)

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use functions in the monitor for real-time data acquisition (RDA) to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Other Terms**

Authorization, authorization check, RSRDA

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The monitor for real-time data acquisition (RDA) does not contain sufficient authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.
