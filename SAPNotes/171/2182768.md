2182768 - Too Many http Services Are Activated

**SAP Security Note 2182768**

**Description**

**Symptom**
If pattern-based service activation is performed, potentially too many services may be activated.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Under certain circumstances, the API for the Internet Communication Framework (ICF) activates an excessive number of services. This leads to a lack of transparency regarding active services and enables unwanted service consumption. For public services, consumption occurs without authentication, while other services require authentication and authorization checks.

**Solution**
This correction ensures that the APIs `HTTP_ACTIVATE_NODE` and `HTTP_INACTIVATE_NODE` support "exact match" for pattern-based activation by default. The previous behavior, which also activates services "similar to the pattern," can be enforced using the new parameters `NOCHECK_FORCE_ACT` and `NOCHECK_FORCE_DEACT`.

**Recommendation**
Implement the Support Package mentioned in this SAP Note or apply the respective correction instructions to address the issue.
