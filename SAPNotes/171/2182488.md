### Symptom

Apache Axis Versionâ€¯1.2.1 library used in the SAP Enterprise Project Connection (EPC) 2.0 product is affected by a security vulnerability (CVE-2012-5784).

### Reason and Prerequisites

The vulnerability arises because Apache Axis version 1.2.1 used in SAP EPC 2.0 does not verify if the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate. This flaw allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers using an arbitrary valid certificate. For more details, refer to the [CVE-2012-5784](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-5784).
