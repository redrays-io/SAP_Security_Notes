     - Enter message class FICUSTOM and select the sub-object 'Messages'.
     - Enter message number 298 and press 'Change'.
     - For German users, enter:
       ```
       Sie haben keine Stammdatenberechtigung f√ºr alle Belege
       ```
     - For English users, enter:
       ```
       You don't have master data authorization for all documents
