**Title**
1513185 - Update 1 for security note 683528

**Description**

### Symptom
This note provides information about the secure operation of SAP DB/MaxDB and liveCache. It includes concerns that have been described by @stake, iDefense, Heise, and others.

### Other Terms
Buffer overflow, niserver, security, denial

### Reason and Prerequisites
You are using SAP DB, MaxDB, or liveCache in Versions 7.3.00, 7.4.02, or 7.4.03.

### Solution
For all SAP DB, MaxDB, and liveCache versions (7.3.00, 7.4.02, 7.4.03, 7.5.00, and higher), follow the correction instructions from [Note 683528](https://me.sap.com/notes/683528).

For Versions 7.3.00, 7.4.02, and 7.4.03, refer to the following points:

- If you are using the tools WebDBM or WebSQL, follow the instructions from [Note 1281820](https://me.sap.com/notes/1281820) to uninstall WebDBM and WebSQL and replace them with MaxDB Database Studio.

- Until WebDBM and WebSQL are replaced with the Database Studio, limit the network access to the host on which the WebDBM or WebSQL service is installed so that only database administrators have access to the WebDBM or WebSQL service. We recommend installing a firewall on the host with the WebDBM or WebSQL service and configuring it so that only specified client hosts of database administrators can access the port of the WebDBM or WebSQL service. Alternatively, group the client hosts of the database administrators together in a separate subnetwork using the host of the WebDBM or WebSQL service; this subnetwork should not permit external access to the port of the WebDBM or WebSQL service.
