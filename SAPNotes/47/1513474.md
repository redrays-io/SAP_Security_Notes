SAP Security Note 1513474 - Missing authorization check in SAP Solution Manager

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can use certain functions of SAP Solution Manager without having the required authorization. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Description**
SAP Solution Manager lacks authorization checks for certain functions, allowing authenticated users to access functionalities without the necessary permissions. This oversight can lead to undesired system behavior and potential security risks.

**Impact**
Unauthorized access to specific functions within SAP Solution Manager can lead to privilege escalation, enabling users to perform actions beyond their intended permissions. This can compromise the security and integrity of the system.

**Solution**
To address this issue, perform the following manual activities in each system where the Note is transported:

1. **Identify RFCs with SM_*_READ Pattern**
   - In SAP Solution Manager, navigate to transaction `SM59`.
   - Search for RFCs matching the pattern `SM_*_READ`.
   - Select each RFC and go to the "Logon & Security" tab.
   - Note the users associated with these RFCs.

2. **Modify User Assignments**
   - Log in to the client where the user exists.
   - Remove the assignment to the role `Z_SOLMAN_READ`.
   - Remove assignments to the profiles `S_CUS_CMP`, `S_CSMREG`, `S_BDLSM_READ`, and `D_SOLMAN_RFC`.
   - Assign the required authorizations to the user.

**Options for Assigning Authorizations:**

- **Without ST-PI 2008_1_<Release> Support Package 05**
  1. Upload the role attached to this note to your client.
  2. Generate the profile for the role and assign it to the user used in the READ RFC connection.

- **With ST-PI 2008_1_<Release> Support Package 05**
  1. Use transaction `PFCG` to create a role, e.g., `Z_SOLMAN_READ_1`.
  2. Switch to the "Authorizations" tab and select "Change Authorization Data".
  3. Choose the template `/SDF/SOLMAN_READ` and generate the role.
  4. Assign the role `Z_SOLMAN_READ_1` to the user.
