1511978 - Preventing change of domain by query strings

## Symptom

Potential false redirection of BSP applications and Web Dynpro applications.  
A domain can be changed and a request can be diverted by setting certain parameters in the query string.

## Other Terms

Query string, security, cross-domain redirection

## Reason and Prerequisites

A BSP or Web Dynpro application can be used to aid in phishing attacks by allowing a malicious user to publish a URL purporting to be from the product, only to redirect the user to a URL of their own choosing. This can enable a malicious user to falsely gain the trust of a victim to elicit private data from that user, such as authentication information.

You can use the table `HTTP_WHITELIST` to prevent attacks like these. Frameworks such as BSP and Webdynpro have integrated this table.

In the whitelist, you configure patterns that can be used to synchronize URLs from external sources. Here, the system verifies that these URLs are acceptable. The whitelist is saved in the table `HTTP_WHITELIST`.

## Solution

Maintain the tables `HTTP_WHITELIST` accordingly.

For more information about maintaining the tables, see the online documentation at:
