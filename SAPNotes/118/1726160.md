1726160 - Security issues fixed in SAP HANA Revision 28 and later

## Description

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered and subsequently fixed in revision 28 and later of SAP HANA.

### Symptom

A malicious user can remotely exploit HANA to terminate it manually. The issues are caused by memory corruption errors that can cause processes to terminate. A malicious user can provoke a condition in which the process attempts to read outside its memory space, causing a memory protection fault. As a result, the system terminates the process, rendering the application unusable until it is restarted.

### Solution

Update your SAP HANA to the newest available revision.
