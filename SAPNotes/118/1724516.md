1724516 - Multiple security vulnerabilities in SDM

**Symptom**
- An attacker can disclose information related to AS Java by exploiting the Software Deployment Manager (SDM). This information could be used to initiate specialized attacks against AS Java and SDM.
- An attacker can remotely exploit SDM to render it unavailable, potentially affecting the resources that serve SDM.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.9
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:A/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

*Note:* SAP provides this CVSS score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue. It does not account for your specific system configuration or operational environment. Always conduct your own risk assessments when determining the applicability or priority of this security note. More information can be found in the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites**
- Information about installed products, their versions, data, and user passwords can be disclosed using SDM. This information might be leveraged by an attacker to further target AS Java.
- An attacker can send a specifically crafted request to cause the SDM server to shut down, leading to a denial of service on AS Java.

**Solution**
1. **Update SDM:**
   - Update the SDM server and the SDM client API to a Support Package (SP) or release where the issue is fixed. Refer to the SP Patch Level section of this [SAP Note 1724516](https://me.sap.com/notes/1724516) for details and available patches.
   
2. **Enable Security Features:**
   - Enable the security features of SDM by following the instructions in the attached [SDM_EnablingSecurity.pdf](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012003146900000325272012&iv_version=0002&iv_guid=A20716AC9AEDEC41966503BFAF3903D0).
