1731835 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in PPM-PFM

**SAP Security Note 1731835: Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in PPM-PFM**

**Description**

PPM-PFM can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Symptom**
PPM-PFM allows unauthorized modification of displayed content and can expose authentication information from other users.

**Other Terms**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- PPM-PFM
- Resource and Portfolio Management

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The issue originates from `CL_RPM_FILE_HTTP_HANDLER` within PPM-PFM, which does not sufficiently encode input and output parameters. This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability, enabling attackers to:
- Non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on the website.
- Steal user authentication information, such as session data.
- Impersonate users, including administrators, potentially compromising application security entirely.
