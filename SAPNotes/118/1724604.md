1724604 - SAP Java Upgrade: change the default secure store key phrase

## Description

### Symptom
A default key phrase is set for the secure store during a switch-based system upgrade with SAPJup.

### Other Terms
secure store, default key phrase, SAPJup, Java upgrade

### Reason and Prerequisites
A default key phrase is set for the secure store by the Java upgrade tool (SAPJup) when upgrading an SAP system from a source release based on SAP NetWeaver 2004 or SAP NetWeaver 7.0 to a target release based on SAP NetWeaver PI 7.10 or SAP NetWeaver 7.3 (switch-based upgrade).

A dialog should be displayed by the upgrade tool prompting the user to replace the default secure store key phrase with a new one. However, due to a bug in the upgrade tool, this dialog is not displayed. Consequently, systems upgraded with the older version of the upgrade tool without the new key phrase dialog still have the default key phrase set on the secure store.

### Solution
Change the secure store key phrase according to [SAP Note 1683616](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001683616) if the system is upgraded with the SAPJup tool version with a patch level lower than PL 54.
