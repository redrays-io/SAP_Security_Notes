2417046 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SAP Netweaver Monitoring application

**Description**

A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Monitoring application of the SAP NetWeaver Java Application Server. Specifically, certain parts of the application do not adequately encode user-controlled inputs, allowing malicious actors to execute unauthorized scripts within the user's browser.

**Impacts**

Exploiting this XSS vulnerability can lead to several security risks, including:

- **Defacement:** Non-permanent modification or defacement of displayed content on the website.
- **Data Theft:** Unauthorized access to user authentication information and session data.
- **Impersonation:** Ability to impersonate the user and access information with the same privileges as the targeted user.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 6.1/10
- **Vector:** 
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network
  - **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low
  - **Privileges Required (PR):** None
  - **User Interaction (UI):** Required
  - **Scope (S):** Changed
  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** Low
  - **Integrity Impact (I):** Low
