2412897 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Enterprise Portal

**Symptom**

Enterprise Portal does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact**

Some well-known impacts of XSS vulnerabilities include:

- Non-permanently defacing or modifying displayed content on a website
- Stealing authentication information of the user, such as data relating to their current session
- Impersonating the user and accessing all information with the same rights as the target user
