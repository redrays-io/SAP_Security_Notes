1861295 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CRM-ISA

**Description / Symptom**
CRM-ISA can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

*Note:* The CVSS base score is an estimate of the risk posed by the issue. It does not account for your specific system configuration or operational environment. Conduct a thorough risk assessment to determine the applicability and priority of this security note.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Pages within CRM-ISA do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content or steal authentication information, potentially compromising the security of the application.
