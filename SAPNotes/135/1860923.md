1860923 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in the Workflow Modeler

## Symptom
Workflow Modeler can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

## CVSS Information
**CVSS Base Score:** 4.3  
**CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS Base Score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this SAP Note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is therefore not intended to replace any risk assessments that you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/) at SAP.

## Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, Workflow Modeler

## Reason and Prerequisites
Input parameters within Workflow Modeler are not sufficiently encoded by `WorkflowModeler.jsp`, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

## Solution
You should deactivate the affected component, which is obsolete. The deactivation is a component of the following Support Packages:

- NW 6.40 from Support Package 29
- NW 7.00 from Support Package 27
- NW 7.01 from Support Package 12
- NW 7.02 from Support Package 15

The component is no longer contained in NW 7.10 and later.

If you are unable to install these Support Packages, you should deactivate the application `tc~workflowmodeler` in the administration work center or block access to the path `/Modeler/*`.

## Affected Components
- **SAP-JEE:** 6.40
- **SAP_JTECHS:** 6.40, 7.00 to 7.02
