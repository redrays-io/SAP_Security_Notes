**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error

**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.05.2012

### Symptom
CRM-IC-ADR can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS

### Reason and Prerequisites
BSP applications `CRM_ITIC_ADJ` and `CRM_ITIC_ADJREP` within CRM-IC-ADR do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. This vulnerability can be exploited to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a website. Additionally, it can be used to steal another user's authentication information, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate the user and access information with the same privileges. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the entire application may be compromised.
