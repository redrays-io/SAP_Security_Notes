**SAP Security Note 1681906**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.05.2012  
**Component:** Supplier Relationship Management > SRM > Bid Invitation (SRM-EBP-BID)

### **Description**
SRM-EBP contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users. This is due to insufficient encoding of OUTPUT parameters in the BSP applications (CFX, CFXML_TEST, CFX_RFC_UI, CFX_TEST_SL, CFX_TEXT, CFX_UI2) and SICF services (CF, CFS, FOLDER, TOPICS, XMB_300), leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issues. An attacker could exploit this to deface or modify web content or steal user authentication data, potentially compromising the entire application if an administrator is impersonated.

Apply the correction instructions provided in this note or install the related support package relevant to your SAP component version.
