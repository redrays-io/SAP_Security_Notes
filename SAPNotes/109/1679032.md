1679032 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CRM-CHM

## Description

**Symptom**

CRM-CHM can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms:** Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), CRM-CHM.

## Reason and Prerequisites

Different pages within CRM-CHM do not sufficiently encode some parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Additionally, reflected XSS can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as session data. An attacker who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
