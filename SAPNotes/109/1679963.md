1679963 - Unauthorized modification in BSP application in CRM-IC-EMS

**SAP Security Note 1679963 - Unauthorized Modification in BSP Application in CRM-IC-EMS**

**Description**
CRM-IC-EMS can be exploited by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without proper authorization. This vulnerability allows attackers to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users, enabling them to impersonate users and access sensitive information with the same privileges. If an administrator account is compromised, the entire application's security may be fully breached.

**Symptom**
- Unauthorized modification of application content.
- Potential theft of user authentication information.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
BSP Pages within CRM-IC-EMS do not adequately encode OUTPUT parameters, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This flaw can be exploited to steal authentication data, allowing attackers to impersonate users and gain unauthorized access.
