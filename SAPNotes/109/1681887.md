1681887 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in IPC UI

**Symptom**

The IPC/AFS UI can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, IPC UI, ConfigUI, Product Configuration, AFS

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages within the IPC product configuration UI do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

1. **Apply the Patch:**
   - Download and apply the patch level indicated in this note using the [Download for SNOTE](https://notesdownloads.sap.com/note/0040000017385702017).

2. **Configure XCM Settings:**
   - Ensure the `structure.hookurl.security` setting is set to `"Secure"` in the XCM settings.
   - If you are passing a value for the request parameter `structure.hookurl` to the product configuration UI, specify exactly one host with a protocol, host name, and port in the `structure.hookurl` setting. This ensures that at runtime, the request parameter is checked to refer only to this host.

   *Note:* If specifying only one host is not feasible, you may not be able to set `structure.hookurl.security` as described. In such cases, contact SAP for further technical support.

3. **AFS (Apparel Footwear Solution) Considerations:**
   - No further action is required on the end-user side for AFS, except applying the patch.
