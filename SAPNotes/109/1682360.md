## Description

### Symptom
`CRM_MKTIMEX_MON` can be exploited by an attacker to modify application content, persist unauthorized changes, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Stored cross-site scripting (XSS), `CRM_MKTIMEX_MON`

### Reason and Prerequisites
The vulnerability in `CRM_MKTIMEX_MON` leads to a stored cross-site scripting issue. An attacker can permanently alter displayed content on a website, enabling the embedding of malicious content that executes automatically without targeting individual victims. This can result in the theft of another user's authentication information, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user and access sensitive information with the same permissions. If an administrator is impersonated, the application's security may be fully compromised.

### Solution
Implement this SAP Security Note to address the vulnerability.
