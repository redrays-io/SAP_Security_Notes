SAP Security Note 2338446 - Clickjacking Framing Protection in MII

## SAP Security Note 2338446 - Clickjacking Framing Protection in MII

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Released On:** July 12, 2016  
**Component:** SAP Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence (MFG-MII)  
**Version:** 1  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer

### Description

**Symptom:**  
SAP Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence (MII), which utilizes Java Server Pages (JSP) technology, is vulnerable to Clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking is a UI-redressing attack where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, exploiting standard HTML features without compromising the application's code.

### Solution

Standard protection measures against Clickjacking, such as the X-FRAME-OPTIONS header, are not suitable for common NetWeaver integration scenarios. Therefore, SAP provides a whitelist-based framework for NetWeaver technologies, detailed in [SAP Note 2319727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319727). This framework offers a solution specifically for MII.

For custom applications based on JSP technology running on SAP NW Java, refer to the attached PDF titled [How_to_Adopt_SAP_Clickjacking_Protection_for_Java_Server_Pages_(JSPs).pdf](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012006153200000839332016&iv_version=0001&iv_guid=6CAE8B3EAD2B1ED690B9AB341A8220C0) included in this note. The document provides guidance on extending Clickjacking protection to custom applications.

### Manual Activities

To enable the Clickjacking Protection Service in NetWeaver 7.1X and above, follow these steps:

1. **Login** to the NWA application.
2. Navigate to the **Configuration** tab.
3. Click on the **Infrastructure** tab.
4. Select **Java System Properties**.
5. Go to the **Application** tab in the second section.
6. Search for `"tc~lm~itsam~service~clickjacking"` in the "Name" column and select the corresponding row.
7. Select the property **ClickjackingProtectionService** and change its value from `"false"` to `"true"`.
8. Save the configuration and **restart the J2EE engine**.

**Caution:** Perform this manual activity separately in each system where you transport the Note for implementation.
