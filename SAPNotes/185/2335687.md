**Status**: Released for Customer  
**Released On**: 22.09.2016  

### Symptom
*Solution Sales Configuration* running on Java Server Pages (JSP) technology is not protected against Clickjacking attacks.

### Other Terms
UI redressing attack, Clickjacking, Framing Protection, Framing, IFrame, UI Redressing, Clickjacking Whitelist, X-FRAME-OPTIONS, AS JAVA, JSP, FBS, SSC, CPQ.

### Reason and Prerequisites

**Reason**  
Clickjacking is a UI-redressing attack where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different than what the user perceives, leveraging standard HTML features without exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's code. More details can be found at [OWASP Clickjacking](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking).

**Prerequisites**
1. [SAP note 2170590](https://me.sap.com/notes/2170590) - Enable and configure Clickjacking solution in SAP NetWeaver Java Server
2. [SAP note 2263656](https://me.sap.com/notes/2263656) - Enable the Clickjacking protection in HTMLB Java
3. [SAP Note 2166717](https://me.sap.com/notes/2166717) - Clickjacking Protection in BSP

### Solution
1. **Standard Protection Measures**  
   Standard protection measures against Clickjacking (X-FRAME-OPTIONS header) are not suitable for common NetWeaver integration scenarios. Therefore, SAP provides a whitelist-based framework for NetWeaver technologies. This framework and its implementation are detailed in [SAP Note 2319727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319727). This note offers the solution for Solution Sales Configuration.

2. **Custom Applications**  
   If you have any custom applications based on JSP technology running on SAP NW JAVA, refer to the attached PDF in this note for guidance on extending the current clickjacking protection to your custom applications.

3. **Configuration Steps**  
   Configure as per the proposed solution in [SAP Note 2166717](https://me.sap.com/notes/2166717) in CRM to use the SSC application with CRM.

4. **Manual Configuration**  
   Refer to [SAP note 2327541](https://me.sap.com/notes/2327541) for configuring Clickjacking protection.
