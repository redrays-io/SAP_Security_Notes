1700195 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BW-BCT-PSM

**Title:** 1700195 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BW-BCT-PSM

**Description:**
SAP Security Note [1700195](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001700195) addresses a critical vulnerability in BW-BCT-PSM. This issue allows an attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, enabling unauthorized modification of displayed content and potential theft of authentication information from legitimate users. The vulnerability specifically affects the BPS planning functionality within BW-BCT-PSM.

**Symptom:**
An attacker can abuse BW-BCT-PSM to modify application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication details from other users. This can lead to impersonation of users, including administrators, thereby compromising the security of the application.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
The vulnerability arises because pages within BW-BCT-PSM do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected XSS issue. Exploiting this can allow attackers to deface or modify displayed content and steal user authentication data.

**Solution:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, implement the SAP Security Note [1700195](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001700195).
