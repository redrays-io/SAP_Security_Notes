1700532 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CA-GTF-RCM

**Overview**

- **SAP Note/KBA**: 1700532
- **Type**: SAP Security Note
- **Version**: 4
- **Recency**: New
- **Language**: English
- **Category**: Program error
- **Priority**: Correction with medium priority
- **Status**: Released for Customer
- **Released On**: February 12, 2013
- **Component**: CA-GTF-RCM (Cross-Application Components > General Application Functions > Records and Case Management)

**Description**

**Symptom**

CA-GTF-RCM can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, CA-GTF-RCM

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Several BSP pages within CA-GTF-RCM do not sufficiently encode INPUT & OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Apply this note.
