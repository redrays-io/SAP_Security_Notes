1700735 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in SAP ME

**Description**

**Symptom**
SAP Manufacturing Execution can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), SAP Manufacturing Execution

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Certain pages within SAP Manufacturing Execution do not sufficiently encode INPUT | OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Additionally, this vulnerability can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as session data. If an administrator is impersonated, the entire application's security may be compromised.

**Solution**
The issue has been addressed in SAP Manufacturing Execution 6.0 SP03. The vulnerabilities were not present in any releases prior to 6.0 SP03.
