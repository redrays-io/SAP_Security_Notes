1499189 - Enhanced checks in report SDB4GEN

**Overview**

This SAP Security Note addresses enhanced checks in the report **SDB4GEN** to prevent potential corruption of reports caused by incorrect subroutine calls within customer programs.

**Symptom**

The report **SDB4GEN** is used within SAP Basis to generate platform-specific reports in systems with the database IBM DB2 for i. Before this correction, an incorrect call of subroutines of the report **SDB4GEN** within customer programs may cause a corruption of reports in exceptional cases.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The report **SDB4GEN** and its subroutines are not intended for use in customer programs. Reports delivered by SAP call the subroutines correctly, eliminating the need for a correction in such cases.

**Solution**

The Support Package assigned to this note introduces additional checks in the subroutines of the report **SDB4GEN**, ensuring that even incorrect calls cannot corrupt existing reports.
