1500307 - DOS Issue Removed in UI

**SAP Security Note 1500307: DOS Issue Removed in UI**

**Symptom**
A potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in MVC within SRM. A malicious user can exploit MVC to render it unavailable, potentially affecting the resources used to serve MVC, leading to a system-wide outage.

**Affected Releases**
- SRM 7.0
- SRM 7.01 SP01
- SRM 7.01 SP02

**Reason and Prerequisites**
- **Infinite Loop:** A malicious user can trigger a condition causing the process to enter an infinite loop, consuming all available processing time and rendering the machine unresponsive until manually terminated.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** An attacker can send specially crafted requests that consume excessive system resources, preventing other processes from allocating new resources and causing a DoS condition.

**Solution**
Import the corresponding support package or implement the attached advanced correction manually to address the vulnerability.
