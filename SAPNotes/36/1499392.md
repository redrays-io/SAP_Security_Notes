1499392 - Missing authorization check in CRM Middleware extractor

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use functionality of the CRM Middleware to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an escalation of privileges.

**Other Terms**

CRMRFCPAR, CRMATAB, CRMDIMA, initial load, compare

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The CRM Middleware extractor lacks permission checks for an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functionality. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

The specified Support Package contains the corrections.

For implementation using transaction SNOTE, note that manual processing steps are required.
