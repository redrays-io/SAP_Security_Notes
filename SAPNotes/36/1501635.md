1501635 - Dynamic SQL Statements Giving Rise to Security Concerns

**Symptom**
Some dynamic SQL statements in the BCA module allow user input to be directly incorporated, enabling malicious users to inject SQL clauses and access unauthorized information. It can be challenging to identify if user input is included in dynamic SQL statements, making them a security risk. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using dynamic SQL statements when possible.

**Impact**
Exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could manipulate SQL queries to retrieve sensitive data, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the system.
