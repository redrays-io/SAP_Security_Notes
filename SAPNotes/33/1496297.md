SAP Security Note 1496297 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in BSP_XP

**Description**

BSP Application `BSP_XP` can be exploited by a malicious user to modify application content, persist unauthorized changes, and potentially access authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Symptom**

The vulnerability allows unauthorized modification of stored content within the `BSP_XP` application, leading to potential security breaches such as unauthorized data access and session hijacking.
