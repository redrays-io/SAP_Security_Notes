1495421 - Unauthorized usage of application functionality in ISE

### Description

**Symptom**  
A malicious user can trigger functionality in Interactive Scripting Editor without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**  
Cross-Site Request Forgery, XSS, Interactive Scripting Editor

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
The interactive scripting editor executes certain functions through referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the user.  
If present, the attacker may use a Cross Site Scripting attack to trigger the exploit, or use an approach in which a link to click is presented to the victim.

**Solution**  
The issue can be fixed by applying the attached correction request. The solution is to escape the URL referred by the Interactive Scripting Editor.
