**Description:**

A malicious user can exploit certain methods or function modules in the package `SESA_ARC` and use specially crafted inputs to execute arbitrary database commands. This can lead to the retrieval, modification, or removal of data persisted by the system.

**Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from an SQL injection flaw. The affected code constructs SQL statements using strings that can be manipulated by a malicious user. This allows the attacker to alter the SQL statement to retrieve additional information from the database or potentially modify it.

**Solution:**

Import the Support Package assigned to this note. The affected methods and function modules are obsolete and are deactivated by this correction.
