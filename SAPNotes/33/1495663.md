1495663 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content

**Symptom**
The Campaign Automation Applet can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
Reflected Cross Site Scripting, XSS, MKTCA

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Several pages within the Campaign Automation BSP application do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross site scripting issue. A reflected cross site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Additionally, it can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. In case an administrator is impersonated, a full compromise of the application's security may occur.
