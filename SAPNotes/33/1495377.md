1495377 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in IC apps.

## Description

**Symptom**

The BSP Applications: `CRMCMP_CCS_EML`, `CRMCMP_CCS_STDR`, `CRMCMP_CTRANSCR`, `CRMCMP_CLM` and BSP Page: `SESSION_BUFFERED_FRAME.HTM` can be exploited by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability may allow attackers to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

These BSP Applications and the BSP Page do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. An attacker can use this flaw to temporarily deface or modify website content or steal authentication data, enabling impersonation of users, including administrators, which can fully compromise the application's security.

**Solution**

Add the page attribute `forceEncode="html"` to the affected BSP pages to ensure proper encoding of output parameters.
