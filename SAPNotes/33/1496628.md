1496628 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CM

---

## Description

The Case Management could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

## Symptom

The Case Management could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

## Other Terms

Reflected Cross-Site Scripting, XSS, Case Management, CM

## Reason and Prerequisites

`SESSION_BUFFERED_FRAME.HTM` & `SESSION_SINGLE_FRAME.HTM` within the Case Management do not sufficiently encode INPUT/OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data could use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the applicationâ€™s security could be fully compromised.

## Solution

In package **"CRM_UIU_CMG"** BSP-Application **"CRMCMP_CMG"**, delete the BSP-Page:

- `SESSION_BUFFERED_FRAME.HTM`
- `SESSION_SINGLE_FRAME.HTM`

## Correction Instructions

1. Use transaction `se80`.
2. Under **Repository Browser**, search for the **BSP Application**: `CRMCMP_CMG`.
3. Under **Pages with Flow Logic**, right-click `session_buffered_frame.htm` and select **Delete**.
4. Under **Pages with Flow Logic**, right-click `session_single_frame.htm` and select **Delete**.
