1496148 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in IS-Media

**Description**

**Symptom**

The IS-Media could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

Reflected Cross-Site Scripting, XSS

**Reason and Prerequisites**

IS-Media does not sufficiently encode issues, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user’s authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data could use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.

If an administrator is impersonated, the application’s security could be fully compromised.

**Solution**

After you implement the corrections, the data that is output is checked for invalid values on all pages of the relevant applications.

If you are using one of the applications that are corrected with this note and you are using a release with a Support Package level that is not corrected by this note, then implement the following manual corrections for the views and pages with flow logic of the BSPs:

- Add the parameter `forceEncode="html"` to the `<%page>` directive.
- Add the parameter `forceEncode="enabled"` to the tag `<htmlb:content>` (not for the pages `default.htm` or `default_old.htm` of BSP ISMCAMPAIGNPICK).
