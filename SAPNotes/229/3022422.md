SAP Security Note 3022422 - [CVE-2021-21481] Missing Authorization Check in SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (MigrationService)

**Symptom**
UPDATE 13th April 2021: This note has been re-released with an updated link to the FAQ document.

The MigrationService, part of SAP NetWeaver, lacks an authorization check. This vulnerability allows an unauthorized attacker to access configuration objects, potentially granting administrative privileges. The impact includes complete compromise of system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
An authorization check is missing in the MigrationService of SAP NetWeaver Java systems.

**Solution**
As a final solution, patch your systems with a new version of the J2EE-APPS.SCA provided in the attached correction measures. This patch adds the missing authorization check.

**Important:** This solution requires an offline deployment and a system restart.

Alternatively, SAP offers a temporary workaround described in [SAP Note 3030298](https://me.sap.com/notes/3030298). This workaround allows an online deployment without an immediate system restart. While it improves security, it is not as robust as the permanent fix. Implement the permanent solution as soon as possible, ideally during the next system restart for any reason.
