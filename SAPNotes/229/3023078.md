3023078 - [CVE-2021-27612] SAP GUI for Windows is vulnerable to redirect users to an untrusted website

### Symptom
In specific situations, SAP GUI for Windows forwards users to a malicious website, which could host malware or facilitate phishing attacks to steal user credentials.

### Reason and Prerequisites
A business user may be directed to an external, malicious website during a business process when a document is downloaded to the frontend. Depending on the security settings in SAP GUI for Windows, the user receives a popup with the options to "Allow" or "Deny" the download:
- **Allow**: The document is downloaded and displayed correctly.
- **Deny**: Due to a program error, instead of displaying an empty page, the user is redirected to an external malicious website.

### Solution
Apply the patches referenced in this SAP Note to ensure that an empty page is displayed correctly when the download is denied, preventing the redirection to malicious websites.
