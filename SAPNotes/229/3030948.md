3030948 - [CVE-2021-27609] Missing Authorization check in SAP Focused RUN

**Description**

**Symptom**

UPDATE 27th April 2021: This note has been re-released with the updated 'validity' section. The validity of the correction instruction has been extended to FRUN 3 FP0.

SAP Focused RUN does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, which allows a user to call the oData service and manipulate the activation for the SAP EarlyWatch Alert service data collection and sending to SAP without the intended authorization.

**Other Terms**

Access control, Authorization error, Authorization profile, [CVE-2021-27609](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27609)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The reason for this authorization issue is a programming error that needs to be fixed.

**Solution**

The provided correction instruction adds the missing authorization checks when activation or deactivation occurs. It is now verified that the user has the necessary authorization to edit the EWA status as well as the authorization to display that system in LMDB. Only if both authorization checks are successful can the user switch between activated and deactivated states.
