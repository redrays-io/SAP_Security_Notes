3027937 - [CVE-2021-27598] Improper Access Control in SAP NetWeaver AS for Java (Customer Usage Provisioning Servlet)

**Description**

Improper Access Control is detected in SAP NetWeaver AS for Java Customer Usage Provisioning (CUP), as the Servlet is not properly protected.

As a result, some statistical data is exposed to public access, which means the Confidentiality is impacted.

The system deletes the current portion of the statistical data after displaying it. As a result, the legitimate consumer—for whom the data is meant—will no longer be able to read it. Therefore, information Integrity is impacted as well.

**Solution**

This correction discontinues public access to the Customer Usage Provisioning servlet by introducing required authentication and authorization protection.

Apply the corrective measure according to the **[Validity](https://me.sap.com/mynotes?note=3027937)** and **[Support Packages & Patches](https://me.sap.com/mynotes?note=3027937)** sections of this note.
