2938162 - [CVE-2020-6293] Unrestricted File Upload in SAP NetWeaver (Knowledge Management)

**Symptom**

SAP NetWeaver (Knowledge Management) allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload a file without requiring any user action. This can enable the attacker to access, modify, or make existing files unavailable. However, the impact is limited to the files themselves and is restricted by other policies such as access control lists and upload file size restrictions.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

- **Reason:** By default, an access point not intended for public usage failed to check authentication for file upload operations.
- **Prerequisites:** None

**Solution**

The affected functions have been updated to properly enforce access restrictions. To mitigate this vulnerability, implement the Support Packages and Patches referenced in this SAP Note.

For detailed information about the affected releases, refer to the "Support Packages & Patches" section of [SAP Note 2938162](https://me.sap.com/notes/0002938162).
