### Description

**Symptom:**  
When the CRM Transaction Launcher is used to launch backend applications, a malicious user can:
- Modify application content
- Persist the modified content without authorization
- Potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users

This vulnerability allows for unauthorized actions such as embedding malicious content or stealing user authentication data.

**Other Terms:**

Applications utilizing the CRM Transaction Launcher are vulnerable to stored XSS attacks. This allows for the permanent modification of displayed content on a website, enabling malicious users to embed content that is automatically rendered without needing to target individual victims. Additionally, attackers can steal authentication information, leading to user impersonation and potential full compromise of the application's security.
