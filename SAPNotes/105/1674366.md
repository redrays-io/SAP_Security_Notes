## Description

### Symptom

The component `CRM_PS_SOA` can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms

Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS); CRM_PS_SOA

### Reason and Prerequisites

Pages within the component `CRM_PS_SOA` do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross site scripting issue. A reflected cross site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. In the case of an administrator being impersonated, a full compromise of the application's security may occur.
