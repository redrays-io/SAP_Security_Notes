---

**SAP Note Number:** 1673279  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 1  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 12.06.2012  
**Component:** Cross-Application Components > Document management (CA-DMS)

### Description

**Symptom**  
Application Component DMS can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**  
Cross-site scripting, XSS, DMS

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
ITS Services (CVW1, CVW3, CVW3A, CVW4, CVW4A, CVWG, DVS_FAVORITE_1, SHOW_DOCS_1, CVWD, CVSE_MAINTAIN, CVSE_SEARCH) within Application Component DMS does/do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting issue.

Cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.

If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**  
Apply this note or import the changes via the relevant support package.  
Refer to [Note 1488500](https://me.sap.com/notes/1488500) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from this note are a prerequisite for the correction of this note.
