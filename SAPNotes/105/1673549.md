**SAP Security Note 1673549 - Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in IS-M-AMC**

**Overview**

This SAP Security Note addresses a critical vulnerability in AMC 3.0 that allows an attacker to modify displayed application content without authorization. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to the theft of authentication information from legitimate users, potentially enabling unauthorized access to sensitive data and compromising the entire application.

**Details**

- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Priority:** Correction with High Priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer
- **Released On:** May 8, 2012
- **Component:** IS-M-AMC (Industry-Specific Components > Media > Advertising Management Classified)
- **Version Affected:** 3.0

**Symptom**

AMC 3.0 is susceptible to unauthorized modifications of displayed content. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to alter the content shown to users, potentially defacing the application or misleading users with false information.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the insufficient encoding of input parameters within AMC 3.0 pages. This lack of proper encoding leads to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue, which can be leveraged to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser. Successful exploitation can result in the theft of session cookies and other sensitive authentication information.

**Impact**

- Unauthorized modification of web content
- Theft of authentication credentials
- Potential impersonation of users, including administrators
- Compromise of application security and data integrity

**Solution**

The vulnerability has been addressed in the standard release starting with version 168 of the application. It is recommended to:

1. **Upgrade to Version 168 or Later:** Ensure that the application is updated to version 168 or a newer release where this vulnerability has been fixed.
2. **Follow Standard Installation Procedures:** Use the standard SAP procedures to install the update, ensuring that all prerequisites are met and that the update is applied correctly.
