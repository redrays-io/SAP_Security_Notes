#### **Symptom**
An attacker can be authenticated to the IPC server used by SAP CRM Mobile Sales without having their own legitimate credentials, or they may escalate privileges.

#### **Other Terms**
Backdoor, hard-coded, credentials, IPC, MSA

#### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The vulnerability is caused by a hard-coded username and password combination in the program's source code. An attacker who specifies these credentials can log on to the system without having been assigned legitimate access by the system administrator(s). If a user already has privileges with which they can log on, an escalation of privileges may be possible if the hard-coded account has higher access rights than the original user.

#### **Solution**
To correct the issue, apply the Java patch valid for your CRM release from the [SAP Service Marketplace](https://me.sap.com/).
