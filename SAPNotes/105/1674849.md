1674849 - Unauthorized modification in BSP application in CRM-IC-CHA

**Description**

CRM-IC-CHA can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Symptom**
- Unauthorized modification of application content.
- Potential theft of authentication information through cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Reason and Prerequisites**
- BSP Pages (SESSION_BUFFERED_FRAME.HTM, SPELLCHECKER.HTM) within CRM-IC-CHA do not sufficiently encode output parameters.
- This insufficient encoding results in a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- An attacker can exploit this to steal session data and impersonate users, potentially compromising administrative accounts.

**Solution**
- Apply this SAP Note or import the changes via the relevant support package to address the vulnerability.
