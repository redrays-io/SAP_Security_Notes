SAP Security Note 1673853 - Unauthorized Modification in BSP Application in IS-HER-CM

---

**Symptom**

IS-HER-CM can be exploited by malicious users to modify displayed application content without authorization. Additionally, attackers may obtain authentication information from legitimate users, potentially leading to unauthorized access and compromised application security.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

BSP Pages such as `session_advisor.htm` and `session_student.htm` in both PIQ_DEMOTT and PIQ_DEMOMODBOOK within IS-HER-CM do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters. This inadequate encoding results in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Exploiting this vulnerability allows attackers to steal user authentication data, impersonate users, and possibly gain administrative access, thereby fully compromising the application's security.

**Solution**

Apply this security note or import the necessary changes via the relevant support package.
