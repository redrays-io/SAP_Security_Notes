1674902 - SLC: Unauthorized modification in BSP application

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.05.2012  
**Component:** SAP Supplier Lifecycle Management > Supplier Data Management  

### Symptom
Application Components SLC-SUP, SLC-QUA, and SLC-REG can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Cross-site scripting (XSS)

### Reason and Prerequisites
BSP Pages (`default.htm`) within BSP applications do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Affected BSP applications:
- `/SRMSMC/PUC_INT`
- `/SRMSMC/QUA_CMN`
- `/SRMSMC/ROS_EXT`
- `/SRMSMC/S3Q_EXT`
- `/SRMSMC/SUP_DELTA`

Cross-site scripting can be exploited to steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution
Implement the corresponding support package or apply the correction instructions.
