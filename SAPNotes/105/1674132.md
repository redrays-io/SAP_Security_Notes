1674132 - Code injection vulnerability in BC-SRV-COM-FTP

## Symptom

BC-SRV-COM-FTP contains code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice.  
An attacker can therefore control the behavior of the system, or can potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code, without having their own legitimate credentials.

## CVSS Information

**CVSS Base Score:** 6.0  
**CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note.

## Other Terms

Backdoor, injection, run, credentials, BC-SRV-COM-FTP.

## Reason and Prerequisites

The program code contains a possibility to define and execute user-defined code that changes the behavior of the system.  
Depending on the code, the user can:

- Inject and run their own code,
- Obtain additional information that should not be displayed,
- Perform a denial of service attack.
