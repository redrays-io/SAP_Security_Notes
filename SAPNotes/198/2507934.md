**Reason and Prerequisites:**

Unnecessary assignment of authorization objects in role `SAP_BPO_CONFIG`.

**Solution:**

The role `SAP_BPO_CONFIG` was changed in SAP Solution Manager 7.2 SP5. Follow the manual instructions in this SAP Note to adjust the role used to execute "Basic BPO Configuration" within SolMan Setup.

**Manual Activities:**

- **For Solution Manager 7.2 SP6 or above:**
  1. If using z-copies of the standard roles in SP6 or above, adjust them manually.
  2. If using standard SAP roles, generate the authorization profile for role `SAP_BPO_CONFIG` and execute the user comparison via transaction PFCG.

- **For lower support levels than SP6:**
  1. Find or create a local copy of the `SAP_BPO_CONFIG` role in your SAP Solution Manager system.
  2. Modify the role by:
     - Deleting all entries for authorization object `S_TABU_DIS`.
     - Adding authorization object `S_TABU_DIS` with the following values:
       - **Activity:** 03
       - **Table Authorization Group:** SS, LMDB, PIMA, SA, IWAD, SC
       - **Activity:** 02
       - **Table Authorization Group:** SA
  3. Save the role and generate the user profile for the role.
  4. Execute the user comparison and ensure no user has the standard `SAP_BPO_CONFIG` role assigned. If found, switch them to the local copy of the role.
