2511453 - Possible leakage of sensitive data in SAP Mobile Platform SDK 3.0

**Symptom**

If the `ClientHubSLL` library of the SAP Mobile Platform Software Development Kit (SMP SDK 3.0) is used on the Android platform without the Mobile Application Framework (MAF) Logon component, a potential security vulnerability exists. This vulnerability may cause confidential data, such as passcodes, to leak unintentionally from the application. However, using MAF Logon, which internally integrates the ClientHub component, mitigates this risk.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 6.9 / 10
- **Attack Vector:** Local (L)
- **Attack Complexity:** High (H)
- **Privileges Required:** High (H)
- **User Interaction:** Required (R)
- **Scope:** Changed (C)
- **Confidentiality Impact:** High (H)
- **Integrity Impact:** High (H)
- **Availability Impact:** None (N)

*Note:* SAP provides this CVSS v3 base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue. It does not account for your specific system configuration or operational environment. Conduct your own risk assessments to determine the applicability and priority of this security note. For more information, refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://support.sap.com/securitynotes).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The `ClientHubSLL` library on Android did not properly validate and authenticate the ClientHub application installed on the device. As a result, an attacker with a maliciously forged ClientHub application could access passcodes and other sensitive data, provided they can install the malicious app on the victim's device.

**Solution**

The vulnerability has been addressed in the `ClientHubSLL` library on Android, which now properly validates the target ClientHub application to which confidential data is sent. To apply the fix:

1. **Upgrade the ClientHubSLL Library:** Ensure you upgrade to the version bundled with SMP SDK 3.0 SP15 PL03 or later.
2. **Rebuild and Redeploy Applications:** Use the updated libraries from the latest SDK to rebuild and redeploy your applications.
