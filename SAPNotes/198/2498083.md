2498083 - Missing Authorization check in Commodity Risk Management (Maintenance of Commodity Curves)

**Description**

Commodity Management does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in escalation of privileges.

Some well-known impacts of Missing Authorization check are:

- Abuse functionality restricted to a particular user group
- Read, modify, or delete restricted data

**Other Terms**

Access control, Authorization error, Authorization profile

**Reason and Prerequisites**

RFC access to commodity curve data via function unit `TPM_TRCO_DCSMD_MAINTAIN` does not perform an authorization check. However, accessing commodity curve data using the official transaction code `TANCCMASTER` performs an authorization check. This means that users working with commodity curves already have the necessary authorizations for transaction `TPM_TRCO_DCSMD`. In cases where customers programmatically call the function unit `TPM_TRCO_DCSMD_MAINTAIN`, user authorizations might need to be adapted accordingly.
