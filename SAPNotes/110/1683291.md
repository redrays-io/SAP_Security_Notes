1683291 - Unauthorized modification in CA-GTF-SP-GEN

**SAP Security Note 1683291 - Unauthorized modification in CA-GTF-SP-GEN**

**Symptom**
CA-GTF-SP-GEN can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The class `CL_BSSP_EMAIL` within CA-GTF-SP-GEN does not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. Cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**
Please apply this note or import the changes via the relevant support package.
