SAP Security Note 1684344 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in IC_BASE

**Description**

BSP application IC_BASE has a vulnerability that allows attackers to modify displayed content without authorization and potentially steal authentication information from legitimate users. This is due to insufficient encoding of INPUT and OUTPUT parameters in HTML pages, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
