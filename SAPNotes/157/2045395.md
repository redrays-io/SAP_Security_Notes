SAP Security Note 2045395 - Missing whitelist check in CA-DMS

**SAP Security Note 2045395**

**Title:** Missing whitelist check in CA-DMS  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 1  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 13.11.2014  
**Component:** Cross-Application Components > Document management (CA-DMS)

### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functions of CA-DMS (old component LO-PDM) to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### Reason and Prerequisites
CA-DMS does not contain required checks against a positive set of allowed functions (i.e., whitelist) during the execution of these functions. This is necessary to verify that authenticated users are permitted to access these functions. The absence of this check may lead to undesired system behavior.

### Solution
Implement the provided support package or follow the correction instructions detailed below.
