**SAP Security Note 2051285** addresses a vulnerability in Netweaver Business Client for HTML 3.0 that allows unauthorized modification of displayed application content. Below are the key details and recommended actions:

---

### **Symptom**
Netweaver Business Client for HTML 3.0 can be exploited by an attacker to modify displayed application content without authorization. Additionally, attackers may obtain authentication information from other legitimate users, potentially allowing them to impersonate users and access sensitive data.

---

### **CVSS Information**
- **Base Score:** 4.3 / 10
- **Vector:**
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network
  - **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium
  - **Authentication (Au):** None
  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** None
  - **Integrity Impact (I):** Partial
  - **Availability Impact (A):** None

*SAP provides this CVSS score as an estimate of the risk. It does not account for specific system configurations or environments. Conduct your own risk assessment to determine the applicability and priority of this security note.*

---

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The vulnerability arises because pages within Netweaver Business Client for HTML 3.0 do not sufficiently encode input parameters, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. An attacker can use this vulnerability to deface or modify website content temporarily or steal authentication information, potentially compromising user accounts and application security.

### **Solution**
Netweaver Business Client for HTML 3.0 was never officially released for SAP_BASIS 720. To mitigate the vulnerability, it needs to be deactivated in this component. Follow these steps:

1. **Start the ABAP transaction SICF.**
2. **Search for the service name "nwbc" on the initial screen.**
3. **On the result page, select any of the listed NWBC nodes and deactivate them:**
   - **Via the context menu ("Disable Service")**
   - **Or via the main menu ("Service/host" → "Disable")**

*Please perform this manual activity separately in each system where you transport the Note for implementation.*
