### Description
In the result list of the where-used list, you can display source code in different ways. Besides the immediate display of a strictly limited part (for example, a line of ABAP code), you can extend this part by expanding it to view it in context. However, from the result list of a where-used list, you can also switch to display mode or change mode for a hit. This action takes you to the relevant processing tool for the workbench object, which often have separate transaction codes. In many cases, these tools can only be accessed using the Object Navigator (transaction SE80).

Therefore, the authorization to execute transaction SE80 is crucial for assigning developer profiles. The system checks whether an authorization to start the Object Navigator (transaction SE80) is assigned to your user profile both before calling the where-used list directly in transaction SE84 and when calling it from other transactions (e.g., transaction SE16N).

### Reason and Prerequisites
The required authorization checks are missing.

### Solution
Implement the corrections using the Note Assistant or import the relevant Support Package. This ensures the system checks the authorization for transaction SE80 before invoking the where-used list.

For releases lower than Release 46C, apply the 46C correction instructions for the modules **REPOSITORY_INFO_SYSTEM_SET** and **RS_EU_CROSS**.
