**SAP Security Note 1252546 - Cross site scripting in JSF**

This SAP Security Note addresses a potential **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability in JavaServer Faces (JSF) applications within the NetWeaver Application Server Java.

### Symptom
Insecure JSF code where user input is not properly validated can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts. This is particularly risky when rendering backing bean properties into attribute values, such as in `<h:outputText>`, `<h:outputLink>`, or `<h:graphicImage>` tags.

### Reason and Prerequisites
If user inputs are not checked at the application level, it may be possible to exploit XSS vulnerabilities leading to potential data breaches or unauthorized actions.

### Solution
- **Upgrade JSF Framework**: Ensure that your JSF framework is version **1.2_08** or higher, as these versions include output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Apply Correction**: For versions lower than Enhancement Package 1 (EhP1), apply the provided correction archive **[ec~java~jsf.sda](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012003146900000546562008&iv_version=0001&iv_guid=4DA1A6BDD4144D4F86A0B5231A12964F)** included in this note.

### Additional Precautions
- **ICM Filter Mechanism**: Configurable standard pattern filters can block direct script injections like `<script>...</script>` or `javascript:...`.
- **SAP Component Library for JSF**: Utilizes Unified Rendering with output encoding to ensure secure handling of attributes.
