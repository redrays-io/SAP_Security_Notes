1251121 - BEx Web 7.0: Display Support Information in Error Pages

```markdown
## Symptom

In the BEx Web Application, when an exception occurs, a full exception page is returned to the client. This page includes the exception description, system deployment information, and other support details useful for SAP support. There is a concern that this information might be misused by unauthorized persons, and you may want to block or hide it from users.

## Solution

To prevent the application from displaying support information on exception pages, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Correction:**
   
   Import the correction (special development) included in the following patch:
   
   - [Download for SNOTE](https://notesdownloads.sap.com/note/0040000016624702017)

2. **Set Java Server Parameter:**
   
   Configure the Java server parameter on all application servers to block the display of support information:
   
   ```
   com.sap.ip.bi.doNotShowStackTraceInExceptionPage=true
   ```
   
   The full notation in the config tool is:
   
   ```
   -Dcom.sap.ip.bi.doNotShowStackTraceInExceptionPage=true
   ```
   
   If this parameter is not set, the default behavior (displaying support information) will be applied.

3. **Additional Configurations:**
   
   This note extends the special development described in [Note 1122437](https://me.sap.com/notes/1122437), which addresses the same issue for external iViews located at:
   
   ```
   pcd:portal_content/com.sap.pct/platform_add_ons/com.sap.ip.bi/iViews/
   com.sap.ip.bi.bex
   ```
   
   To avoid displaying support information on the following URL:
   
   ```
   com.sap.ip.bi.web.portal.integration.launcher
   ```
   
   you should implement this solution as well.

## Implementation Instructions

1. **Import Support Packages:**
   
   - Import Support Package 19 for SAP NetWeaver 7.0 BI Java (BIBASES19_0.SCA / BIWEBAPP19_0.SCA) into your BI system. The support package will be available when [Note 1160173](https://me.sap.com/notes/1160173) with the short text "SAPBINEWS 7.0 BIJava SP 19" is released for customers.

2. **Urgent Cases:**
   
   In urgent cases, use the correction instructions. The SCAs BIBASES and BIWEBAPP must be redeployed.

3. **Compatibility:**
   
   Be aware of [Note 1163789](https://me.sap.com/notes/1163789) regarding synchronized Java Patch delivery. Only the highest SPS will be provided with new patches compatible with lower Support Package Stacks.
