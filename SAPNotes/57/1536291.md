1536291 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CRM EP

## Description

### Symptom
This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see [Security Note 1557426](https://me.sap.com/notes/1557426).

The CRM portal integration could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting, XSS, CRM portal integration.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Dynamic Navigation iViews within the CRM portal integration do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a web site. Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data could use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the application's security could be fully compromised.

### Solution
Apply the attached SP patch level.
