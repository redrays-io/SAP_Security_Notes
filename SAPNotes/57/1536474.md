1536474 - SAP ME MFG 5.2 is vulnerable to XSRF attacks.

### Symptom

An unauthorized user can trigger functionality in SAP ME MFG 5.2 on behalf of an unsuspecting authorized user by fooling the unsuspecting user into triggering a URL callback via a script or special HTML element parameter.

### Other Terms

Cross-Site Request Forgery, CSRF, XSRF, SAP ME MFG 5.2

### Reason and Prerequisites

SAP ME MFG 5.2 executes state-changing functionality via referencing URLs. In certain scenarios, it is possible for an unauthorized and unauthenticated third party to trigger this functionality on behalf of an authorized authenticated user without the latter's knowledge and/or consent.

### Solution

XSRF attacks must be addressed within web applications. These applications must ensure that for state-changing operations they are not solely relying on credentials or tokens that are automatically submitted by browsers. A common approach is to include a special token in each request, which is associated with the user session and is valid only for the session lifetime.

To correct this issue, please apply the supplied security patch 5.2.5.1.
