1. Refer to [note 1481392](https://me.sap.com/notes/1481392) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from note 1481392 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.

Then either:
- Apply the SRM correction by applying the corresponding Support Package (SP).
- Apply the SRM code changes via SNOTE. This may only work properly if you have at least SRM_SERVER 500/550 SP 15. Lower SP releases might work.
