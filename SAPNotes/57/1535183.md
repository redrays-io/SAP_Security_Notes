### Description

#### Symptom
A malicious user can trigger functionality in PY-US-PS without authentication and authorization.

#### Other Terms
Cross-Site Request Forgery, XSRF, PY-US-PS

#### Reason and Prerequisites
PY-US-PS executes certain functions through referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the user.

If present, the attacker may use a Cross Site Scripting attack to trigger the exploit, or use an approach in which a link to click is presented to the victim.

#### Solution
Due to a legal change, the affected BSP is no longer valid after 31.12.2010. It is switched off with note [1530008](https://me.sap.com/notes/1530008). To implement a correction to the security issue, please apply note 1530008 or the corresponding support package.
