**SAP Security Note 1536124 - Multiple entry points to client code**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.03.2011  
**Component:** BC-MOB-LAP - Basis Components > SAP NetWeaver Mobile Infrastructure > Laptop Client for Data Orchestration Engine (DOE)

### Symptom
Multiple entry points to client code in BC-MOB-LAP, BC-MOB-PDA.

### Reason and Prerequisites
NetWeaver Mobile client code has multiple entry points. A malicious user can run the functions which have these entry points without starting the client in the normal manner. The user can therefore execute pieces of client code as if they were standalone functions, resulting in unexpected and potentially unpleasant behavior.

### Solution
The correction is implemented for this issue. To obtain the fix, please upgrade the client to at least the patch level specified in the "SP Patch Level" section of this note, relevant to your release and Support Package (SP).
