1534251 - Missing authorization check in IW_TNG

---

**Symptom**

- An authenticated user can use functions of IW_TNG to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.
- A security breach was found in the user subscription process.
- Failure to implement this note can lead to exposure of business data.
- This problem appears in all versions prior to Duet Enterprise SP02.

**Other Terms**

Authorization, authorization check, IW_TNG

**Reason and Prerequisites**

IW_TNG does not contain authorization checks for checking an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

- This problem can be avoided by having the system reside behind a firewall.
- If the problem has already appeared, add an authorization object check to the user subscription service.
  - **Authorization Object name:** S_USER_AGR
  - **Field ACTVT:** '03'
- To check if this solution worked, try to enable the service with a user that has not been assigned the authorization object.
