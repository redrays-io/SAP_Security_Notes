1536087 - Update #1 to security note 1522651

**SAP Security Note:** 1536087

**Title:** Update #1 to security note 1522651

**Release Date:** 14.12.2010

**Category:** Program error

**Priority:** Correction with high priority

**Status:** Released for Customer

### Description

#### Symptom
After applying note 1522651, clicking on some links within SRM results in the following errors:

- `"ITS_P:019 XSRF no sec_sesstoken"`
- `"Conflict when starting service ... Service call ... to transaction was terminated because ok code ... is prohibited as start ok code in service ... for transaction"`

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Program error.

#### Solution
1. **Refer to [Note 1481392](https://me.sap.com/notes/1481392)** for additional information and instructions. The corrections from this note are a prerequisite for implementing this update.
2. **Implement the correction instructions** of this note. This will create the report `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_SRM_2` in your system.
3. **Execute the report `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_SRM_2`** (only after running `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_SRM` from [Note 1522651](https://me.sap.com/notes/1522651)) and specify a transport request number when prompted. The report will add service parameters for the adapted ITS services, which can be maintained via the GUI configuration pushbutton for a service within transaction SICF.

**Afterwards, choose one of the following:**
- Apply the SRM correction by applying the corresponding Support Package (SP).
- Apply the SRM code changes via SNOTE. This method may only work properly if you have at least SRM_SERVER 500/550 SP 15. Lower SP releases might work as well.
