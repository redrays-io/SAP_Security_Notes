1612819 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in CA-GTF-TS-WSI

**SAP Security Note 1612819** addresses a critical vulnerability in the CA-GTF-TS-WSI component. This security issue allows a malicious user to perform unauthorized modifications to application content, persist these changes, and potentially steal authentication information from legitimate users. The vulnerability is classified as a **stored cross-site scripting (XSS)** attack, which can lead to severe security breaches, including impersonation of users with higher privileges, such as administrators.

### **Symptom**
CA-GTF-TS-WSI can be exploited by malicious actors to:
- Modify application content without authorization.
- Persist modified content, leading to permanent changes.
- Steal authentication information from other users, potentially allowing impersonation and unauthorized data access.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The vulnerability arises from inadequate input validation within the CA-GTF-TS-WSI component, which permits the storage and rendering of malicious scripts. This can lead to:
- Permanent modification of displayed web content.
- Automatic rendering of embedded malicious content without targeting individual victims.
- Theft of user authentication information, enabling impersonation and access to sensitive data.
