SAP Security Note 1612700 - Missing Authorization Check in ICM

## Overview

**SAP Note Number:** 1612700  
**Title:** Missing authorization check in ICM  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Release Date:** March 13, 2012  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer

## Description

**Symptom:**  
An authenticated user can access functions of ICM that should be restricted, potentially leading to an escalation of privileges.

**Reason:**  
ICM lacks authorization checks to verify a user's permissions for accessing certain functions, which may result in unintended system behavior.

**Solution:**  
The insufficient authorization check allows users to access the obsolete transaction `CACS_GETSOURCE`. This transaction is no longer needed and should be deleted to prevent unauthorized access.

### Manual Correction Steps

1. Go to transaction `SE93`.
2. Enter the transaction code `CACS_GETSOURCE`.
3. Click on the **Delete** icon.
4. Click on the **Save** button.

## Affected Software Components
