1611926 - Missing authorization check in PI Monitoring

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use functions of PI Monitoring to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Other Terms**

Authorization, authorization check, PI Monitoring

**Reason and Prerequisites**

PI Monitoring does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's permission to access certain functions. This oversight may lead to undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

The authorization checks have been corrected to properly verify permissions for PI Monitoring access. To address this issue, please update the software components of WebAS Java to the Support Packages and patch levels specified in the "SP Patch Level" section of this note, or use newer versions.

For deployments in the 7.3 and 7.3.1 releases, perform the following additional steps for the SOA MONITORS and SOA MONITORS BASIC components:

1. **Undeploy DC (Development Component)** named `tc~pi~editor~perm` from SC (Software Component) **SOAMON**.
2. **Undeploy DC** named `tc~pi~monitor~perm` from SC **SOAMONBASIC**.
3. **Update** to the latest versions of Software Components **SOA MONITORS (SOAMON)** and **SOA MONITORS BASIC (SOAMONBASIC)**.
