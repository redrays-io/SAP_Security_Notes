1614259 - Command injection vulnerability in MFG-MII

## Symptom

MFG-MII contains code that permits the execution of operating system commands of the user's choice. A malicious user can therefore control the behavior of the system.

## Other Terms

Command injection, MFG-MII

## Reason and Prerequisites

The program code contains a possibility to receive user input that allows the execution of operating system commands. This might change the behavior of the system. The user can:

1. Inject and run dangerous operating system commands,
2. Obtain additional information that should not be displayed,
3. Modify data, delete data,
4. Modify the output of the system,
5. Create new users with higher privileges,
6. Perform a denial of service attack.

## Solution

All the malicious code has been removed in **MII 12.1 SP06** and **MII 12.2 SP02**. Please update to the above-mentioned releases to get the changes.
