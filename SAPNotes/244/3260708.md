## Description

**Symptom**

1. **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2022-41258)**
   
   Due to insufficient input validation, SAP Financial Consolidation allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious scripts when running a common query in the Web Administration Console. On successful exploitation, an attacker can view or modify information, causing a limited impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.

2. **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2022-41260)**
   
   SAP Financial Consolidation does not sufficiently encode user-controlled input, which may allow an unauthenticated attacker to inject a web script via a GET request. On successful exploitation, an attacker can view or modify information, causing a limited impact on the confidentiality and integrity of the application.
