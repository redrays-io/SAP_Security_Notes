3263436 - [CVE-2022-41211] Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author and SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer

---

**Symptom**

This SAP security note addresses a vulnerability identified in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author and SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer. The vulnerability details along with their CVE relevant information can be found below.

Due to lack of proper memory management, when a victim opens a manipulated file received from untrusted sources in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author and SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer, Arbitrary Code Execution can be triggered when the payload forces:

- **Re-use of a dangling pointer** which refers to overwritten space in memory. The accessed memory must be filled with code to execute the attack. Therefore, repeated success is unlikely.
- **Stack-based buffer overflow.** Since the memory overwritten is random, based on access rights of the memory, repeated success is not assured.

**CVSS Score:** 7.0
