SAP Security Note 2043506: Solution Manager File System Browser - Restrict File Content Access

**Symptom**
Using the File System Browser application, users might potentially have read and download access to sensitive files such as certificates.

**CVSS Information**
- **Base Score:** 3.5
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

**Solution**
Deploy the `LM-SERVICE` Java component where the issue is fixed. Refer to the "Support Packages & Patches" section for more details.

**Improvement and Required Configuration**
This correction introduces a new whitelist property in the agelet configuration `com.sap.smd.agent.application.filesystem`: `smd.white.list.extensions`.

- Files with extensions **not** in the whitelist will still appear in the File System Browser but their content can no longer be displayed or downloaded.
- Editing the whitelist requires the `SAP_RCA_AGT_ADM` administrative role.
