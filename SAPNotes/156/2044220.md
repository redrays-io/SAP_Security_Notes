2044220 - Missing authorization check and potential remote code execution in SAP ASE

### Symptom

An authenticated user can use functions of SAP ASE (Adaptive Server Enterprise) to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges and a potential buffer overflow giving the attacker complete control of the product.

### Reason and Prerequisites

SAP ASE does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.
