2039924 - Missing authentication check in file sharing feature of IOS for SAP Work Manager app

**SAP Security Note 2039924 - Missing authentication check in file sharing feature of IOS for SAP Work Manager app**

**Released On:** September 9, 2014  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Version:** 3  
**Category:** Program error

### Symptom
Downloaded attachments are stored in an unsecure file location (documents folder) on the SAP Work Manager iOS client.

**CVSS Information**  
**CVSS Base Score:** 2.1  
**CVSS Base Vector:** AV:L/AC:L/AU:N/C:P/I:N/A:N  

### Reason and Prerequisites
The attachment feature was added to SAP Work Manager 6.0. Downloaded attachments are stored in the documents folder. When the device is synced with iTunes, any attachments uploaded with SAP Work Manager can be seen in the iTunes document folder.

### Solution
Attachments are now saved in the Application Directory folder, ensuring that when the device is synced to iTunes, attachments are no longer visible in the iTunes document folder.  
**Upgrade to the latest release of SAP Work Manager 6.1** to apply this correction.
