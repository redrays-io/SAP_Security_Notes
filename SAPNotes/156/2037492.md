2037492 - Potential denial of service in SAP Router

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Released On:** October 14, 2014  
**Version:** 3  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Category:** Program error  
**Component:** Basis Components > Client/Server Technology > Network Interface (BC-CST-NI)  

### **CVSS Information**
- **Base Score:** 7.1
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:N/A:C

### **Symptom**
A malicious user can remotely exploit the SAProuter process to render it unavailable. This can potentially affect the resources used to serve SAProuter, leading to a denial of service.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The issue is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can send a specifically crafted request that causes the process to consume excessive resources. This prevents other processes from allocating new resources, making the system unavailable. This condition can be intentionally triggered by an attacker to cause a denial of service.

### **Solution**
Implement the latest kernel with the included patch.
