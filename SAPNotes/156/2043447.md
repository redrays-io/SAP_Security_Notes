### Description

**Symptom:**  
An authenticated user can use functions of SV-SMG-BPCA to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Reason:**  
SV-SMG-TWB-BCA does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access certain functions. This oversight can lead to undesired system behavior.

### Solution

Implement the provided support package or correction instructions in both the managed system and the Solution Manager System. This will introduce new authorization checks affecting functionalities such as:

- TBOM obsolescence check
- TBOM creation
- BPCA analysis

Additionally, perform the manual activities outlined in the note to ensure proper authorization configurations. These manual steps include updating read RFC roles and adding necessary authorization objects to the SAP_SM_BPCA_TBOM role.
