**CVSS Information**  
**CVSS Base Score:** 7.1  
**CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:N/A:C

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

#### Reason and Prerequisites

An attacker can trigger a condition in which the process enters an endless loop, causing it to consume all of the available processing time. This causes the entire machine to become unresponsive until the process is terminated manually. An attacker can use this flaw to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

The problem is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can launch a specifically crafted request that causes the process to consume excessive resources. As a result, no other processes can allocate new resources, rendering the system unavailable. This condition can be intentionally provoked by an attacker to cause a denial of service.
