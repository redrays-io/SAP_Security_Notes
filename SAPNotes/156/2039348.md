_SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. It does not account for your system's specific configuration or operational environment._

### Reason and Prerequisites
GRC-ACP does not perform required checks against a whitelist of allowed functions during execution. This absence can lead to unauthorized access to restricted functions.

### Solution
Implement the provided support package or follow the correction instructions along with the attached manual instructions.

#### Manual Activities
1. **Maintain entries in the table `SRT_WHITE_LIST`**:
   - If the table does not exist, implement note [#1560878](https://me.sap.com/notes/1560878) first.
   - Go to transaction SE11, open table `SRT_WHITE_LIST` in display mode.
   - Navigate to Utilities → Table Contents → Create Entries.
   - Enter `OBJECT_TYPE` as 'FUNC' and `OBJECT_NAME` as the NON-GRCPI function name you wish to call.
   - Save the changes.

2. **Update Message Class**:
   - Go to Transaction SE91 and open the message class `/GRCPI/GRIA_MSG`.
   - Create or change Message 175 with the short text: "Function Module does not exist in Whitelist".
   - Save the changes.
