1580244 - AUTHORITY_CHECK Permits Testing Using RFC

**Description:**
SAP Security Note 1580244 addresses a vulnerability where the function module `AUTHORITY_CHECK`, being remote-enabled, allows attackers to access user authorization information. This information disclosure can be exploited for targeted attacks against users.

**CVSS Information:**
- **Base Score:** 3.5
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N
- This score reflects a low to moderate risk, primarily impacting confidentiality with minimal complexity and requiring some level of user interaction.

**Affected Components:**
- SAP_BASIS across various releases including 46C, 620, 640, 700, 710, 711, 720, 730, and 731.

**Solution:**
1. **Automatic Mitigation:**
   - Use the Note Assistant (`SNOTE`) to implement the correction instructions provided in the note.
   - Alternatively, import the relevant Support Package specific to your SAP_BASIS version. Support packages can be found [here](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB46C64).

2. **Manual Mitigation (if automatic steps are not feasible):**
   - **Create Function Group SU_RAUTH:**
     - Development class: SUSR
     - Short text: Authority check from external system
     - Save and activate the changes.
   - **Create Function Modules:**
     - **RFC_GET_LAST_FUNCTION_MODULE** in function group URFC:
       - Delivers the last function module called via RFC.
     - **SU_RAUTH_CHECK_FOR_USER** in function group SU_RAUTH:
       - Performs remote-enabled authority checks for users other than `sy-uname`.
       - Includes several import parameters for detailed authorization checks.
   - Detailed manual steps and configurations can be found in the [correction instructions](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001580244/41).
