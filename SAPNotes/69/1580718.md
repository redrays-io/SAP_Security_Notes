**Title**: Directory Traversal in BC-SRV-ARL  
**Type**: SAP Security Note  
**Released On**: September 22, 2011

### Description

Archivelink contains a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to perform directory traversal, potentially writing arbitrary files on the remote server. This could lead to the disclosure of confidential information or data overwrites on the remote system.
