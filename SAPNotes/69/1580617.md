SAP Security Note 1580617 - Code Injection Vulnerability in SV-SMG-UAE

**Symptom**
SV-SMG-UAE contains code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice. A malicious user can therefore control the behavior of the system or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without having their own legitimate credentials.

**Other Terms**
Backdoor, injection, run, credentials, SV-SMG-UAE

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The program code includes a feature that allows the definition and execution of user-defined code, altering the system's behavior. A valid and authenticated user is required. Depending on the code, the user can:
- Inject and run their own code
- Obtain additional information that should not be displayed
- Modify or delete data
- Alter system output
- Create new users with higher privileges
- Perform a denial of service attack

**Solution**
To address the security issue, implement this SAP note via the SNOTE transaction. These issues are fixed in ST710 SP2 and later releases.
