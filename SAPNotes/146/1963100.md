1963100 - Disabling execution of operating system commands using a CTC URL

**Symptom**
It is possible to execute any operating system commands using a CTC URL where it should not be allowed.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 9.0
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:S/C:C/I:C/A:C

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The CTC application contains a vulnerability where any operating system command can be executed on an AS Java host using NWA credentials through a URL invocation. Typically, this requires authentication using NWA credentials. If you have not already implemented SAP security note [1445998](https://me.sap.com/notes/1445998), then this can be done without authentication using NWA credentials.

**Solution**
Apply the official patch for the respective release from the [Service Market Place](https://me.sap.com/) to disable the command invocation using a URL automatically.

Please also implement SAP security note [1445998](https://me.sap.com/notes/1445998) if not already done.
