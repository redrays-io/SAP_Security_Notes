**SAP Security Note: 1961948**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 1  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 18.02.2014  
**Component:** Miscellaneous > Country/Region-Specific Developments > Slovenia > use FI-LOC-FI-SI

### Symptom

`/CCEE/FISIRFEBKA00` contains a vulnerability through which an attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly disclosing confidential information.

### Other Terms

Directory traversal, `/CCEE/FISIRFEBKA00`

### Reason and Prerequisites

`/CCEE/FISIRFEBKA00` fails to correctly validate the path that is used to reference a file that is read from the remote server. As a result, an attacker can potentially direct the program to an arbitrary other file in the system, disclosing its contents.

### Solution

As a general rule, SAP recommends that you install a solution by applying a **Support Package**. However, if you need to install a solution earlier, use the **Note Assistant** and follow the described instructions:

1. Apply manual corrections as given in the attachment.
2. Apply code correction instructions from the note using transaction SNOTE.
3. For additional information and instructions see [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003). The corrections from Note 1497003 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.

The following logical file name has been created to enable the validation of physical file names: **/CCEE/SIFI**

**Recommendations for setting up logical file names:**

To avoid maintaining a high number of logical file names, some of the programs share the same logical file name. Using the same logical file name for various programs creates dependencies among these programs. To securely separate data created by different users and different programs, try to create a directory structure that reflects the user name and/or program name and use this information when setting up the physical path and file names for the logical file paths and file names.
