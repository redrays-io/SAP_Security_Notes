1963932 - Missing encryption for form based authentication

**Description**

**Symptom**

In cases where a HANA XS-based application is configured to enforce encrypted access, a non-encrypted form-based authentication might occur instead.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 2.9
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:A/AC:M/AU:N/C:P/I:N/A:N

**Other Terms**

- Form-based login
- Encryption
- Force SSL

**Reason and Prerequisites**

A HANA XS-based application can be configured to accept only encrypted requests by enabling the **Force SSL** option. If unauthenticated users access the application, they are redirected to the form-based login component (if configured). Without the **Force SSL** setting on the form-based login, authentication might occur without encryption. After successful authentication, users are redirected back to the application with encryption enforced.

**Solution**

- **For HANA Revision 70 and later:**
  The system behavior has been improved to forward encrypted authentication requests to an encrypted form-based login, even if the form-based login component isn't explicitly configured with the **Force SSL** option.

- **For Revisions Prior to 70:**
  Set the **Force SSL** option using the XS admin tool:
  1. Navigate to the XS administration tool at `https://<host>:<XS port>/sap/hana/xs/admin/index.html`.
  2. Locate the form-based login application object at the path `sap.hana.xs.formLogin`.
  3. Enable **Force SSL** for the form-based login component.

**Manual Activities**

You must perform this manual activity separately in each system where you transport the Note for implementation.
