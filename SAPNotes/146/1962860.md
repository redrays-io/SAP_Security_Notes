1962860 - Unauthorized Use of Application Functions in BPC 7.5

**Symptom**
An attacker can execute functions in BPC 7.5 without authentication and authorization.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.8
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

**Other Terms**
Cross-site request forgery, XSRF, BPC

**Reason and Prerequisites**
BPC Client applications (Excel client, Admin client, Server Manager, etc.) execute certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The attacker may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

**Solution**
Corrections have been made to the BPC Client and .NET Server applications and are available in:
- BPC 7.5 SP17
- BPC 7.53 SP08
- BPC 7.54 SP03

Corrections have also been made to ODBO SP11 to be compatible with these BPC .NET Server versions.
