SAP Security Note 1961946 - Directory Traversal Vulnerability in /CCEE/FISIFP_1450

**Symptom**

`/CCEE/FISIFP_1450` contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to potentially write arbitrary files to the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The vulnerability exists because `/CCEE/FISIFP_1450` fails to correctly validate the path to which a user-submitted file is written. As a result, an attacker can potentially overwrite data in the remote system.

**Solution**

SAP recommends installing a solution by applying a **Support Package**. If an immediate solution is required, follow these steps using the **Note Assistant**:

1. **Apply Manual Corrections**: Follow the instructions provided in the attached document.
2. **Apply Code Corrections**: Use transaction `SNOTE` to apply the code correction instructions from this note.
3. **Prerequisite Note**: Ensure that [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) is implemented, as its corrections are necessary for this note.

A new logical file name has been created to validate physical file names: **/CCEE/SIFI**

**Recommendations for Setting Up Logical File Names**

To minimize the number of logical file names and avoid dependencies among programs:

- **Create a Reflective Directory Structure**: Design a directory structure that reflects the user name and/or program name.
- **Secure Separation**: Use this structure when setting up the physical path and file names to securely separate data created by different users and programs.
