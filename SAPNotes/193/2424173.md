**Action Steps:**
1. **Update:** Apply the above revisions or later versions to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
2. **Deactivate:** If the user self-service tools are not needed, consider deactivating them as a temporary workaround.

_By default, the SAP HANA user self-service tool functionality is deactivated, and the vulnerabilities cannot be exploited in this state._

_To check if the user self-service tool is active, execute the following SQL query:_
```sql
SELECT NAME, STATUS FROM "_SYS_XS"."SQL_CONNECTIONS" WHERE NAME = 'sap.hana.xs.selfService.user::selfService'
```
_If activated and not needed, deactivate it via the SAP HANA XS Admin interface._
