2423429 - Code Injection vulnerability in SAP Web Dispatcher

**Summary**
A Code Injection vulnerability has been identified in SAP Web Dispatcher, allowing attackers to bypass whitelists and blacklists by manipulating the `x-forwarded-for` HTTP header. This vulnerability enables unauthorized access to restricted applications.

**Details**

**Symptom**
SAP Web Dispatcher permits an attacker to exceed the length of whitelists and blacklists stored in the `x-forwarded-for` HTTP header. This exploitation can conceal the attackerâ€™s IP address, granting access to protected applications.

_SAP provides this CVSS v3 base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue. It does not account for specific system configurations or operational environments. Conduct your own risk assessment to determine applicability and priority._

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The vulnerability arises because SAP Web Dispatcher does not adequately validate the length of the `x-forwarded-for` HTTP header, allowing attackers to manipulate it and bypass access restrictions.

**Solution**
Apply the referenced SAP Web Dispatcher patch. The patch ensures that attackers cannot bypass the whitelists and blacklists by limiting the length of the `x-forwarded-for` HTTP header.
