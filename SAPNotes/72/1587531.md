SAP Security Note 1587531 - Directory Traversal in class system reports

**Title:** 1587531 - Directory Traversal in class system reports

**Description:**
A vulnerability exists in the classification reports (`RCCLUKA2` and `RMCLTEXT`) that allows a malicious user to perform directory traversal. This can enable the writing of arbitrary files on the remote server, potentially leading to data corruption or alteration of system behavior.

**Affected Components:**
- **SAP_APPL:** Versions 31I to 46C
- **SAP_ABA:** Versions 620 to 730

**Solution:**
1. **Implement Advance Correction:**
   - Follow the correction instructions as outlined in the note.
2. **Define Logical File Names:**
   - Use transaction `FILE` to define the following logical file names if they are not already available:
     - `CLASS_TEXT` for report `RMCLTEXT`
     - `RCCLUKA2_KSSK` and `RCCLUKA2_AUSP` for report `RCCLUKA2`
3. **Assign Physical File Names:**
   - Enter the physical paths for the logical file names in transaction `SF01`.
4. **Reference Prerequisite Note:**
   - Apply [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) as it is a prerequisite for this security note.
