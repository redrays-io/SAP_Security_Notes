### Description

#### Symptom
A malicious user can execute functions in Web Dynpro ABAP without authentication and authorization.

#### Other Terms
Cross-site request forgery, XSRF, Web Dynpro ABAP

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Web Dynpro ABAP executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The malicious user may use a cross-site scripting attack to achieve this or present a deceptive link to the victim.

### Solution
In the affected application in Web Dynpro ABAP, only test BSP applications are involved. These test BSP applications are deleted with this correction. Implement the correction instructions or import the relevant Support Package.

**Correction Instructions:**

1. Log on to the system and call transaction **SE80**.
2. In the Repository Browser, select the entries for BSP applications and delete the following applications:
   - `WDR_TEST_SES1`
   - `WDR_TEST_SUS_B`
3. Start transaction **SICF** and delete the corresponding services:
   - `/sap/bc/bsp/sap/wdr_test_ses1`
   - `/sap/bc/bsp/sap/wdr_test_sus_b`
