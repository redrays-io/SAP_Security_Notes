1586927 - Unauthorized Use of Application Functions in BROWSE_PLANE

**Overview**
A security vulnerability has been identified in the BROWSE_PLANE application within the SAP system, allowing malicious users to execute functions without proper authentication and authorization. This issue poses significant risks, including potential unauthorized access and manipulation of application functions.

**Symptom**
A malicious user can execute functions in BROWSE_PLANE without authentication and authorization.

**Affected Components**
- **Software Component:** BC-WD-CMP-FPM (Basis Components > Web Dynpro > Configurable Component > Floorplanmanager)
- **Release Versions:** 701, 702, 711, 720, 730

**Reason and Prerequisites**
BROWSE_PLANE executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request with a specific URL and parameters, the function executes with the user's permissions. This can be achieved through cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks or by presenting malicious links to the victim.

**Solution**
To address this security issue, perform the following actions:
1. **Delete the BSP Application:** Remove the BROWSE_PLANE BSP application from your SAP system.
2. **Delete the SICF Node:** Remove the SICF node located at `sap/bc/bsp/sap/browse_plane`.
