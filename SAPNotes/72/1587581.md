## Symptom

A malicious user can execute functions in the Business Workflow without proper authentication and authorization. This vulnerability can be exploited through cross-site request forgery (XSRF) or by tricking an authenticated user's browser into executing specific URLs with parameters.

## Impact

Unauthorized access to workflow functions may compromise business processes, data integrity, and overall system security. This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed within the workflow system, potentially affecting critical business operations.

## Solution

3. **Activate XSRF Protection:**
   - Execute the program `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_BC_BMT_WFM_2` and select the appropriate transport request when prompted. This will activate XSRF protection for the adjusted applications.
