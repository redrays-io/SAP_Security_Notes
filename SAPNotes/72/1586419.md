1586419 - Potential denial of service in SDM

**Symptom**
A malicious user can remotely exploit SDM and render it unavailable, as well as potentially the resources that are used to serve SDM.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 5.0
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:N/I:N/A:P

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/) at SAP.

**Other Terms**
- DoS, Denial of Service, SDM

**Reason and Prerequisites**
A malicious user can trigger a condition in which all legitimate users are barred from logging into SDM. This causes the machine to be unable to service legitimate users. A malicious user can use this flaw to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack.

**Solution**
In case you suffer from DoS on SDM, block the port used by SDM and limit it to internal use only. The SDM is using a specific port number and not typical ports, like HTTP/HTTPS ports, that are shared with other applications, so the change will only affect the SDM.
