**Description**

### Symptom
When working with Xcelsius dashboards that display BW data in the BEx runtime, exceptions can be raised. These exceptions were rendered as an HTML error page including stack trace information and presented to the user. This information could be used by malicious users to start specialized attacks.

### Reason and Prerequisites
An unexpected program error occurs and leads to an exception.

### Solution
The user will be shown a generic error message with a unique ID referring to a log entry that contains detailed error information. The log itself can only be accessed by privileged users. This way, a non-privileged user has no access to stack trace information.
