1505967 - Potential disclosure of persisted data in SCM-BAS-SCH

**Summary**
A critical SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in the SCM-BAS-SCH component of SAP Supply Chain Management. This vulnerability allows malicious users to manipulate database commands, potentially exposing sensitive persisted data.

**Affected Components**
- **Component:** SCM-BAS-SCH (Supply Chain Management > SCM Basis > Configurable Process Scheduling)
- **Versions Affected:**
  - SCM 400
  - SCM 410
  - SCM_BASIS 500
  - SCM_BASIS 510
  - SCM_BASIS 700
  - SCM_BASIS 701

**Description**
A malicious user can exploit the SCM-BAS-SCH component by using specially crafted inputs to modify database commands. This manipulation can lead to the retrieval of additional information persisted by the system, posing a significant security risk.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The vulnerability arises from an SQL injection flaw where the code constructs SQL statements by incorporating user-controllable strings without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to alter the intended SQL commands to access unauthorized data.

**Solution**
Implement the attached source code corrections provided in SAP Note [1505967](https://me.sap.com/notes/1505967) to mitigate the SQL injection vulnerability.
