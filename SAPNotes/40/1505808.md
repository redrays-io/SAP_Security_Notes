**SAP Security Note 1505808 - Unauthorized Usage of Application Function in Interaction Center**

**Summary**
- **Note Number:** 1505808
- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Version:** 1
- **Priority:** Correction with high priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer
- **Released On:** December 14, 2010
- **Component:** Customer Relationship Management > Interaction Center WebClient > Framework
- **Language:** English

**Description**
A malicious user can trigger functionality in the following BSP applications without authentication and authorization:
- CRM_IC_MDB
- ICCMP_CCS
- CRM_IC_MDB_PERS
- ICCMP_GLOBAL
- ICCMP_BT_GLOBAL
- BSP_BROADCAST

Affected ITS service:
- CCMP_RABOX

**Other Terms**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF, CSRF)

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The Interaction Center application executes certain functions through specific URLs. An attacker can trick an authenticated user's browser into making requests with these URLs and parameters, executing functions with the user's privileges. This can be leveraged through:
- Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- Malicious links presented to the victim

**Solution**
- **For CRM 701:** Implement the related correction instructions.
  
- **For CRM 700 and earlier releases:**
  1. Refer to [Note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324) for additional information and instructions. Corrections from this note are prerequisites for implementing this note.
  2. Implement the correction instructions of this note. This creates the reports `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_IC_MDB_<release>` and `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_MISC_2` in your system.
  3. Execute the reports `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_IC_MDB_<release>` and `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_MISC_2`, specifying a corresponding transport request number when prompted. This fills the `BSPTEMPXSRFSTORE` table with entries for the adapted BSP applications.
  4. **Note:** If your system is already upgraded to a basis support package containing [Note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324), the BSP metadata repository will be populated correctly, eliminating the need for manual table entries.

**Manual Activities**
Refer to the Correction Instructions section above for detailed manual activities required pre- and post-implementation.
