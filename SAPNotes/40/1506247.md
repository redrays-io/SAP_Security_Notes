## Symptom

A malicious user can remotely exploit SRM and render it, as well as potentially the resources that are used to serve SRM unavailable.

## Other Terms

Notes, Longtext, Size of text, timeout, SRM, Denial of Service, Security.

## Reason and Prerequisites

A malicious user can trigger a condition in which the process enters an infinite loop, which causes it to consume all available processing time. This results in the entire machine being unresponsive until the process is manually killed. An adversary can use this flaw to launch a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
