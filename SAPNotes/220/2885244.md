2885244 - [CVE-2020-6242] Missing Authentication check in SAP Business Objects Business Intelligence Platform (Live Data Connect)

## Symptom

To enable SAML for Live Data Connect, the documentation requires the user to activate the trusted authentication. In case the BIPRWS application server was not protected with a specific certificate, it allows an attacker to log on to the Central Management Console without a password.

**Impacts of Missing Authentication Check:**
- **Read, modify, or delete sensitive information**
- **Access administrative or other privileged functionalities**
- **Possibility to crash the service, directly impacting availability**

## Other Terms

- **Broken Authentication**
- **LDC**
- **Live Data Connect (LUC)**
- **[CVE-2020-6242](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6242)**

## Reason and Prerequisites

The BIPRWS application server is configured to enable trusted authentication but was not protected with a specific certificate to allow only the trusted client to use SDK.

**Affected Versions:**
- SAP BOE Live Data Connect 1.0
- 2.0
- 2.X
- 2.1

## Solution

Upgrade to the latest available version of Live Data Connect.
