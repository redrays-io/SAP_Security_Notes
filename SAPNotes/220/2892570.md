2892570 - Missing XML Validation vulnerability in ABAP Development Tools

**SAP Security Note 2892570** addresses a critical vulnerability in ABAP Development Tools that affects versions up to and including 3.8.2.

### **Symptom**
ABAP Development Tools do not sufficiently validate an XML document accepted from an untrusted source.

### **Impact**
Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to:
- Arbitrary files retrieval from the server.
- Denial-of-service conditions.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The vulnerability arises from the `java.beans.XMLDecoder` used to deserialize formatter settings stored as serialized Java objects. A crafted formatter setting can allow arbitrary code execution on the frontend machine with the privileges of the logged-on user. This requires that an attacker can place a crafted formatter configuration in the backend system or inject it during transfer between the backend system and the ABAP Development Tools client.

### **Solution**
Upgrade to **ABAP Development Tools version 3.8.3** or later. The issue is resolved by using a custom `org.xml.sax.ContentHandler` that validates the XML input, allowing only known safe classes to be deserialized. This change effectively prevents the execution of malicious code through unknown class names.

### **Affected Software Components**
- **SAP_BASIS_AIE** from version 3 to 3.

### **CVSS Score**
- **Score:** 5.9
- **Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
