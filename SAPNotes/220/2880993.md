2880993 - [CVE-2020-6177] Missing XML Validation vulnerability in SAP Mobile Platform

**Symptom**

SAP Mobile Platform does not sufficiently validate an XML document, allowing an attacker to supply malicious input that could lead to a partial denial of service. However, SAP Mobile Platform does not allow External-Entity resolving, so there is no risk of leaking server file contents.

**Impact**

- **CVE:** [CVE-2020-6177](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6177)
- **CVSS Score:** 4.3
- **CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#%7B%22vector%22:%22CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L%22%7D)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

1. Attacker must authenticate with SAP Mobile Platform (valid credentials required).
2. JVM limits the number of entity expansions by default (controlled by system property `-Djdk.xml.entityExpansionLimit`), making exploitation and causing system instability more difficult.

**Solution**

The vulnerability has been fixed in SAP Mobile Platform **3.0 SP17 PL03** by completely disabling Entity resolution. It is recommended to upgrade to SAP Mobile Platform **3.0 SP17 PL03** or later to prevent Entity resolution.
