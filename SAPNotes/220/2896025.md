**SAP Note:** [2896025 - [CVE-2020-6282] Server-Side Request Forgery in SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (IIOP service)](https://me.sap.com/notes/2896025)

**Description:**
A **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** vulnerability has been identified in the IIOP service of SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA. This vulnerability allows attackers to send crafted requests from a vulnerable web application to target internal systems behind firewalls, which are typically inaccessible from external networks. Potential impacts include:

- Scanning internal networks to map infrastructure
- Gathering information for further exploits or attacks
- Performing Remote File Inclusion attacks
- Retrieving sensitive server files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
- Bypassing firewalls to execute malicious requests through the server

**CVSS Score:** 5.8  
**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

**Solution:**
Implement a whitelist mechanism using the newly introduced multivalue properties `allowed.client.hosts` and `allowed.orb.hosts` in the SAP NetWeaver AS Java IIOP service.

- **allowed.client.hosts:** Specify trusted client hosts (e.g., `12.34.56.78;host1;host2`)
- **allowed.orb.hosts:** Specify allowed orb hosts and their ports (e.g., `12.34.56.78:2345,3456,4567;host1:2345,3456;host2:4567`)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Update SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA:** Apply the corrective measures as outlined in the "Validity" and "Support Packages & Patches" sections of this SAP Note.
2. **Configure Whitelists:** If you have standalone IIOP clients, add their IPs or hostnames to the `allowed.client.hosts` property to authorize their connections.
