2880664 - [CVE-2020-6178] Insufficient session expiration in SAP Enable Now Manager

## Description

**Symptom**

SAP Enable Now Manager sends the Session ID cookie value in the URL. A URL that contains confidential data such as the session ID might be stolen from browser history or log files.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The download of portable components of SAP Enable Now Manager (JNLP, SENL, and DNT) used session IDs for authentication. These session IDs were sent via a cookie value in the URL.

**Solution**

In JNLP, SENL, and DNT SAP Enable Now, the Session ID authentication has been replaced with a nonce token, which can be used only once and within a limited time frame to obtain a new session ID.

Within this short validity period, an unauthenticated request can be made to the server providing the nonce to be authenticated. If the unauthenticated request takes longer than the defined timeframe, a Java login dialog will be presented. See [SAP Note: 2873233](https://me.sap.com/notes/2873233).

The nonce mechanism is implemented within the SAP Enable Now release 1911.

**Action for On-Premise Customers**

Please upgrade your installed SAP Enable Now instance to version 1911 or later.
