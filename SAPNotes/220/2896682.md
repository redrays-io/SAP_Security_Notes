2896682 - [CVE-2020-6225] Directory Traversal vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver (Knowledge Management)

**Symptom**

SAP NetWeaver Knowledge Management does not sufficiently validate path information provided by users, allowing characters that represent 'traverse to parent directory' to pass through to the file APIs. This vulnerability enables an attacker to overwrite, delete, or corrupt arbitrary files on the remote server, leading to Path Traversal.

**Other Terms**

- Path traversal
- Backtracking
- Directory climbing
- KM
