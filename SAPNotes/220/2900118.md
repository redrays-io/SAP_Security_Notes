**Description**
SAP OrientDB 3.0 has a critical code injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-6230) that allows an authenticated attacker with script execute/write permissions to inject and execute malicious code. This vulnerability can lead to elevated privileges and full control over the application's behavior.

- **Availability Impact:** High

**Affected Component**
- **Software Component:** ORIENTDB
- **Versions Affected:** 3.0

**Solution**
Upgrade to at least **OrientDB 3.0.29** to mitigate this vulnerability. The update includes a class filter for the Nashorn script engine, restricting access to system-level functionalities.

**Additional Information**
The vulnerability exploits the JDK's Nashorn Script Engine, allowing the execution of elevated JavaScript code by authenticated users with script execution privileges. By default, the admin role has this privilege. Upgrading to the patched version may impact existing users who rely on certain Java classes, requiring explicit additions to the `allowedPackages` parameter in `orientdb-server-config.xml`.
