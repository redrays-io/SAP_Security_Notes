SAP Security Note 2392860 - Leveraging privileges by customer transaction code

**SAP Security Note 2392860** addresses a vulnerability where certain SAP standard roles include a transaction code reserved for customers. This misconfiguration allows a malicious user to execute unauthorized transaction functionalities by leveraging these custom transaction codes, potentially escalating their privileges.

### **Symptom**
In some SAP standard roles, a transaction code reserved for customers (ZPTTNO_TIME) is used. A malicious user with access to this transaction code can execute unauthorized functionalities, leading to privilege escalation. This requires the user to have permissions to develop and transport custom transactions to the productive system.

- **Vector:** 
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
  - **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H)
  - **Privileges Required (PR):** Low (L)
  - **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)
  - **Scope (S):** Changed (C)
