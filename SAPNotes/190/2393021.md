2393021 - Adobe SDK XSS vulnerability - Flex

**Symptom**

The binaries of the `wd.flex` project used in developing Flex applications are vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability can be detected by downloading the Adobe tool from [Adobe Flex Security Issue APSB11-25](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-builder/kb/flex-security-issue-apsb11-25.html#main_main_solution).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

This vulnerability was identified in the third-party Adobe SDK. Consumers using the older, unpatched SDK will have vulnerable Flex binaries both in libraries and applications. Adobe has released a patched SDK that addresses this vulnerability.

**Solution**

Adobe has provided a patched SDK that resolves the XSS vulnerability. We have incorporated this SDK into our framework. To mitigate the vulnerability, deploy the latest `WDRUNTIME.sca` on your systems. This ensures that the binaries delivered via `WDRUNTIME` are invulnerable to Cross Site Scripting attacks.
