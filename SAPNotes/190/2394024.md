### Symptom
The solution **Defense Forces and Public Security** (EA-DFPS) does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in escalation of privileges.

#### Impacts of Missing Authorization Check:
- **Abuse of functionality** restricted to a particular user group
- **Read, modify, or delete restricted data**

Multiple RFC-enabled function modules belonging to the **IS-DFS-MM** component do not contain sufficient authorization checks to verify an authenticated user's permissions to access certain functions.
