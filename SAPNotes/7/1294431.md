**Description**

When working in SAP CRM, fully-qualified URLs of object links can be visible and copied by users. In certain scenarios, these URLs may contain session information. Improper system configuration can allow other users with the copied URLs to access the sender's session. This poses a security risk as session URLs can be exploited.

The root cause is that HTML anchor tags are generated with `href='#'`. Browsers interpret this `#` as a relative reference within the page, replacing it with the full page address. Consequently, the full address becomes visible and can be copied by users. While there are more appropriate security measures to prevent session reuse, this note addresses the issue by preventing end-users from seeing fully qualified URLs unnecessarily. The recommended approach is to use `href="javascript:void(0);"` for anchor elements to avoid exposing HTTP information.

**Solution**

Implement the following enhancement:

1. Modify HTML anchor tags to use `href="javascript:void(0);"` instead of `href="#"` to prevent the exposure of full URLs.
2. Apply [Note 1136402](https://me.sap.com/notes/1136402), which implements similar fixes for InputField and Checkbox tags.
