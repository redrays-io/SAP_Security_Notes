1304803 - Security note: Changing a transport without authorization

## Header Data
- **Type**: SAP Security Note
- **Version**: 10
- **Priority**: HotNews
- **Status**: Released for Customer
- **Released On**: 24.07.2012
- **Component**: Basis Components > Change and Transport System > Workbench/Customizing Organizer

## Description

### Symptom
Certain reports that do not have an authorization check can create or change transport requests and change the piece list of a request.
This is a security breach.

### Other Terms
Security breach

### Reason and Prerequisites
This problem is caused by a delivery error.

### Solution
Use the Note Assistant to implement the correction instructions or import the relevant Support Package.

If the report **TH_E070E** also exists in your system, delete it manually. For technical reasons, we cannot provide general correction instructions for this report. If the package **STRW** does not exist in your system, you must first call transaction **SE03** -> "Change Object Directory Entries" and change the package from **R3TR PROG TH_E070E** to **SDEL**.
In this case, the package change must be transported together with the deletion of the report.

The correction does not influence the normal functioning of the Transport Organizer (transactions **SE01**, **SE09**, or **SE10**) or other applications.
The Transport Organizer does not use the reports in any way.

We strongly recommend that you implement this note to eliminate this security flaw.
