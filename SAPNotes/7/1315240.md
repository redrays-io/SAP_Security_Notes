*Released on: October 8, 2009*

### **Description**

This security note addresses a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the theme functionality of Web Channel applications. To mitigate such vulnerabilities, new restrictions have been implemented for theme names used within these applications.

**Symptoms:**

- Improper sanitization of certain characters in theme names may allow XSS attacks.

**Affected Components:**

  - Backslash (\\)
  - Slash (/)
  - Point (.)
  - Comma (,)

Any other characters will be automatically removed from the theme name. To modify this behavior, adjust the `theme.core.name.filter` parameter using the following navigation path:

```
General Application Settings
    --> Customer
        --> application_security
            --> application_security_config
                --> theme.core.name.filter
```

**Example:**

  ```
  my very%cool.theme-here+summer@ä2000
  ```

  ```
  my verycool.theme-here+summer2000
