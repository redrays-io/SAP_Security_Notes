SAP Security Note 1294913: Insecure Methods in KWEdit.dll

---

**Overview**

SAP Security Note **1294913** addresses a security breach in the component **KWEDIT.DLL**. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute damaging code through a buffer overflow attack, access foreign computers, download files from the Internet, and transfer them to any directory.

**Affected Versions**

The security breach affects the following SAP GUI versions:

- **SAP GUI 6.20** (KW add-on patch level 11 and lower)
  - Component: SAP KWEdit Control (KWEDIT.DLL)
  - Up to Version: 6200.1.1.46

- **SAP GUI 6.40** (KW add-on patch level 6 and lower)
  - Component: SAP KWEdit Control (KWEDIT.DLL)
  - Up to Version: 6400.1.1.46

- **SAP GUI 7.10** (KW add-on patch level 4 and lower)
  - Component: SAP KWEdit Control (KWEDIT.DLL)
  - Up to Version: 7100.1.1.46

**Impact**

The presence of KWEDIT.DLL on the front end, even if the SAP Knowledge Warehouse front-end tools are not actively used, is sufficient for the security breach to occur.

**Solution**

- **SAP GUI 6.20 & 6.40:**
  - A correction is not possible in these versions. It is recommended to upgrade to **SAP GUI 7.10** or higher.

- **SAP GUI 7.10:**
  - Apply **KW add-on patch 5** for SAP GUI 7.10 on each front end where the SAP Knowledge Warehouse front-end tools are installed.
  - [Note 1034521](https://me.sap.com/notes/1034521) provides the location of KW add-on patches on SAP Service Marketplace.
  
  *Note:* When applying KW add-on patches, you may encounter the following error:

  ```
  The system cannot find the file specified
  <installation path SAP GUI>\DwReg32.ocx.uninstall.reg
  ```

  This error does not affect the effectiveness of the security patches.

  Until **KW add-on patch 5** is applied, refer to **[Note 1092631](https://me.sap.com/notes/1092631)** for information about "kill bits," which prevent SAP GUI files from being instantiated on Web sites from Microsoft Internet Explorer.
