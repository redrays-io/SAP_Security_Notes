### Description

This note provides background information about the HTTP security session management of the SAP NetWeaver Application Server (AS) ABAP.

**Other Terms:** SICF_SESSIONS, SM05, SAP_SESSIONID_<system id>_<client>, ICF, Internet Communication Framework

### Reason and Prerequisites

To use HTTP security session management, you require:
- AS ABAP 7.0 as of Enhancement Package 2 (SAP_BASIS 7.02)
- **OR** AS ABAP 7.2 (SAP_BASIS 7.20) and subsequent releases.

**Transactions:**
- **SICF_SESSIONS:** Activate/deactivate HTTP security session management for each logical system (ABAP client).
- **SM05:** Overview of all currently available (cross-server) security contexts, similar to **SM04** for server-specific application contexts.

### Solution

A security session is established between an HTTP client and an HTTP server (ABAP: logical system) as a result of a successful logon and ends upon logoff. The session ID is stored in a security context on the server and is transferred using a non-persistent cookie. This allows web applications to authenticate without requiring repeated logons, provided the existing session meets the application's authentication requirements.

**Key Points:**
- **Reauthentication:** If an application requires different authentication data, reauthentication is necessary, updating the security context and generating a new session ID.
- **Differences from Logon Tickets (MYSAPSSO2):**
  - Security sessions are system-specific (client-specific).
  - Sessions can be ended by the server based on inactivity.
  - Activation allows FORM-based logon even without logon tickets, permitting SERVICE/SYSTEM type users.

**Important Information:**
- **SAP NetWeaver Portal Users:** Implement correction instructions in [Note 1471069](https://me.sap.com/notes/1471069) before activating security session management to ensure complete logoff from the portal.
- **Profile Parameter `icf/user_recheck`:** When HTTP security session management is active, this parameter behaves as if set to `1`, enhancing compatibility with one-time token logon procedures like SAML.
