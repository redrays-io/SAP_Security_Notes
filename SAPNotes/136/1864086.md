1864086 - Update 1 to Security Note 1665930

**Title:** 1864086 - Update 1 to Security Note 1665930

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Category:** Program error  
**Released On:** May 24, 2013  
**Component:** Financials > Business Analytics (FIN-BA)  

### Description

**Symptom**  
FIN-BA can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**  
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), FIN-BA

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
The `UAB_COST_ENGINE` BSP application does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website or steal a user's authentication information. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

*Note:* This update note addresses the omission of SEM-BW 747 in the original security note 1665930.

### Solution

Implement the SEM-BW 747 correction of [note 1665930](https://me.sap.com/notes/1665930) or apply the corresponding support package.
