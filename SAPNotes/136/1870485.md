1870485 - Missing authorization check in CA-EUR

**SAP Security Note 1870485 - Missing authorization check in CA-EUR**

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functions of CA-EUR (software component DMIS) to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.0
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note.

**Other Terms**

**Reason and Prerequisites**
CA-EUR does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**
Implement the correction instruction in all affected systems (i.e., all systems that contain software component DMIS). You can find the correction instructions [here](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001870485/1365).
