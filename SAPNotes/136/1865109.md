1865109 - Potential information disclosure in Diagnostics Agents

**SAP Security Note 1865109** addresses a potential information disclosure vulnerability in Diagnostics Agents. Here's a summary of the key details:

### Description

An attacker can discover information related to credentials used for connecting to Solution Manager. This information could be leveraged to specialize attacks against Solution Manager, potentially leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 6.0
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

*Note:* The CVSS score provided is an estimate of the risk and does not account for specific system configurations or environments. Perform your own risk assessments to determine the applicability and priority of this security note.

### Reason and Prerequisites

Connections of Diagnostics Agents to Solution Manager require an elevated role to be established in a trusted manner. If compromised, this role could be exploited to target Solution Manager and obtain unexpected privileges.

### Solution

The implementation introduced in this security note allows the use of a non-elevated role for Diagnostics Agent connections. This new role has no privileges, ensuring that an attacker cannot use it to perform critical actions on the Solution Manager system.

### Affected Components
