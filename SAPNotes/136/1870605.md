### Title
**1870605 - Privilege escalation in SAP HANA**

### Description

#### Symptom
SAP HANA contains code that can allow a user to authenticate to SAP HANA without having their own legitimate credentials, leading to a privilege escalation.

#### Other Terms
Privilege escalation, SAP HANA

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The vulnerability is caused by a security problem in the program's source code. An attacker who has specific information can log on to the system with high system privileges without having been assigned legitimate access by the system administrator(s).

#### Solution
Update to at least revision 57. With SAP HANA revision 57, the code was changed so that the privilege escalation is no longer possible.
