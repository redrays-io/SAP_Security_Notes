### Description

#### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functions of CRM-FM-ACL to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

#### CVSS Information
- **CVSS Base Score**: 6.0

*Note: This CVSS score is an estimate and does not account for your specific system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace your own risk assessments. For more information, please refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/).*

#### Reason and Prerequisites
CRM-FM-ACL does not perform required checks against a whitelist of allowed functions during execution. This omission allows authenticated users to access functions they should be restricted from, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and undesired system behavior.

### Solution
Implement the necessary support packages or follow the correction instructions provided in this security note to ensure that whitelist checks are enforced within CRM-FM-ACL.
