1895848 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in UR

---

## Symptom

UR can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

## CVSS Information

**CVSS Base Score:** 4.3 / 10  
**CVSS Base Vector:**

| Key                                        | Value         |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------|
| AV : Access Vector (Related exploit range) | Network (N)   |
| AC : Access Complexity (Required attack complexity) | Medium (M)    |
| Au : Authentication (Level of authentication needed to exploit) | None (N)      |
| C : Impact to Confidentiality              | None (N)      |
| I : Impact to Integrity                    | Partial (P)   |

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

## Other Terms

Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, UR

## Reason and Prerequisites

Pages within UR do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

## Solution

To fix this issue, please see the description for your basis framework:

**Important remark regarding theming:** In case of using an Enterprise Portal with a custom theme, it might be necessary to update the `eppserv.sca` (7.0x) or `ep-basis.sca` (â‰¥ 7.1x). See [note 1446099](https://me.sap.com/notes/1446099).

### A) Web Dynpro ABAP

See related note section for the corresponding ABAP note: [1929564](https://me.sap.com/notes/1929564)

### B) Web Dynpro JAVA

The issue described above will be fixed by a rendering-related Web Dynpro for Java patch. In the section "SP Patch Level," you can find information about which patches contain the respective correction. Please install this patch or a newer one (patches are always cumulative).

If the section "SP Patch Level" is not available or the information about which patch contains the correction is missing, this means that this has not been determined yet. In this case, please re-check this note at a later point in time.

**Downloading Web Dynpro for Java Patches:** All Web Dynpro for Java patches are available on [SAP Service Marketplace](https://me.sap.com/notes/330793). [Note 330793](https://me.sap.com/notes/330793) explains how to download patches from SAP Service Marketplace.
