**Title:** Directory traversal/SQL injection in SPM1.0

### Symptom

1. SPM1.0 content contains a vulnerability through which a malicious user can potentially write arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.
2. A malicious user can exploit SPM1.0 code and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, resulting in the modification of data persisted by the system.

### Other Terms

directory traversal, SQL injection, SPM1.0, Spend Performance Management, xSA, Spend Analytics

### Reason and Prerequisites

SPM1.0 code contains code which fails to correctly validate the path a user-submitted file is written to. Through this, an attacker can potentially overwrite data on the remote system.

The second issue is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement including strings that can be altered by a malicious user. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to modify information in the database.
