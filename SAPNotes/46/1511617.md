### Symptom
Component FI-BL-PT-FO: Potential directory traversal  
This security note has been updated. For more information see security note [1538366](https://me.sap.com/notes/1538366).

### Other Terms
Path traversal, directory, traversal, FI-BL-PT-FO

### Reason and Prerequisites
1. The programs listed in the correction instructions contain a vulnerability that a malicious user could use to read any files, potentially containing confidential data, on a remote server.
2. Some of the programs listed in the correction instructions contain a vulnerability that a malicious user could use to overwrite any files on a remote server in order to potentially destroy data or to change the system response.

### Solution
See [1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) for additional information on this issue. The corrections from Note 1497003 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.

**Logical File Names:**
- **FI_DME_DOWNLOAD_PATH**  
  **FI_DME_DOWNLOAD_FILE**  
  *Programs:* Transaction FDTA

- **FI_DME_CREATE_PATH**  
  **FI_DME_CREATE_FILE**  
  *Programs:* SAPFPAYM, RFFOD__L, RFFOD__U, RFFOD__Z

If you do not want to check the file name and path, you do not have to take any action.  
If you want to carry out a check, in transaction FILE, define an actual path or actual file name for the above logical file names and logical path names.

**Note:** If the check fails, no payment medium file is created either. If the check fails in transaction FDTA, the system issues an information message and the file is not downloaded.

After you implement the corrections from this note, implement the corrections from [Note 1538366](https://me.sap.com/notes/1538366) also. The corrections do not contain the logical file names and paths.
