**Symptom**

A malicious user can trigger functionality in SRM Java Tool Box without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Java Tool Box executes certain functions through referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the user.

If present, the attacker may use a Cross Site Scripting attack to trigger the exploit, or use an approach in which a link to click is presented to the victim.

**Solution**

You can find SRM Java Tool Box 7.0 in the Support Package and Patch Area of the [Service Marketplace](https://me.sap.com/).
