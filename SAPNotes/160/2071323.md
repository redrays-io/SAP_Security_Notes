### **Description**

Financial Consolidation 10.0 can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### **CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 4.3
- **Access Vector (AV):** Network (N)
- **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium (M)
- **Authentication (AU):** None (N)
- **Confidentiality (C):** None (N)

**Note:** The CVSS base score provided by SAP is an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. It does not account for your specific system configuration or operational environment.

### **Details**

Pages within Financial Consolidation 10.0 do not sufficiently encode input parameters, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this to:

- Non-permanently deface or modify displayed content.
- Steal authentication information from other users, potentially allowing impersonation and unauthorized access.

### **Solution**

Install Support Package SP14 to address and mitigate this vulnerability.
