### Reason and Prerequisites
BI-BIP-INV Application does not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected XSS can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution
This problem has been resolved and the fix is available. Please check the [Support Packages and Patches](https://me.sap.com/softwarecenter/template/products/_APP=00200682500000001943&_EVENT=DISPHIER&HEADER=Y&FUNCTIONBAR=N&EVENT=TREE&NE=NAVIGATE&ENR=73555000100200001041&V=MAINT) section.

### Additional Information
Reflected cross-site scripting can be exploited to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content and steal authentication information, potentially allowing attackers to impersonate users and compromise application security.
