**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error

### Description

#### Symptom
This SAP note introduces new switchable authorization checks for RFC function modules in Biller Direct to enhance system security.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Remote Function Call (RFC) modules are traditionally protected using the authorization object `S_RFC`. However, it has been identified that `S_RFC` alone may not suffice for securing certain RFC function modules. This note provides additional authorization checks to ensure secure execution. Ensure that your system includes these RFC function modules in the `S_RFC` authorizations before activating the new checks.

#### Solution
New switchable authorization checks are delivered inactive to maintain compatibility with existing processes. They can be activated using transaction `SACF` as outlined in the manual correction instructions included with this note.

**New Authorization Scenario:**
- **Scenario 1:** `BD_COCODEDATA_CHANGE` - Defines authorization checks for changing Biller Direct company code data.

**Affected Business Processes and Roles:**
- Users editing and posting bank statements must possess the additional authorization `F_ACT_EBPP`.

**Affected RFC Function Modules:**
- `APAR_EBPP_KNB1_EXT_ADD`
- `APAR_EBPP_KNB1_EXT_CHANGE`
- `APAR_EBPP_KNB1_EXT_DELETE`
- `APAR_EBPP_KNB1_EXT_GET`
- `APAR_EBPP_LAST_UPLOADED_INVID`
- `EBPP_APAR_CHANGE_PAYMENT_ADV`
- `EBPP_APAR_GET_PAYMENT_ADVICES`
- `EBPP_GET_COMMFLAGS`
- `EBPP_SET_COMMFLAGS`
- `R_FARMATCH_READ_ALL_FDKMAIL`
- `R_FDKUSER_READ_DATA`

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create the Authorization Scenario Definition:**
   - Navigate to transaction `SACF` and verify the existence of `BD_COCODEDATA_CHANGE`.
   - If absent, download the [BD_COCODEDATA_CHANGE.txt](https://me.sap.com/notes/2069588/BD_COCODEDATA_CHANGE.txt) attachment.
   - Use transaction `SACF_TRANSFER` to upload the scenario definition and assign it to the development package `AA`.

2. **Activate the Productive Authorization Scenario:**
   - In `SACF`, select the scenario definition and transfer it to a productive scenario.
   - Set the scenario status to `Active` or `Logging`:
     - **Active:** Enables authorization checks and logs to the Security Audit Log.
     - **Logging:** Logs actions without enforcing authorization checks, useful for identifying required authorizations.

3. **Enable Security Audit Logging:**
   - Ensure Security Audit Log is active via transaction `SM19`.
   - Create and activate relevant audit message filters.

4. **Adjust User Roles:**
   - Utilize report `RSAU_SELECT_EVENTS` to identify users needing updated authorizations.
   - Modify roles to include the necessary authorizations based on audit findings.
