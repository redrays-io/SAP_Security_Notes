SAP Security Note 2072641 - Authorization checks for RFC in Patient Register

**Title**: Authorization checks for RFC in Patient Register

**Description**:
This SAP Security Note introduces enhanced authorization checks for RFC function modules used in patient-dependent search and correction reports within the patient register. The update ensures that remote calls to RFC function modules are secured not only by the existing S_RFC authorization checks but also by additional Patient-Authority checks, thereby strengthening overall system security.

**Reason and Prerequisites**:
- **Issue Identified**: The existing S_RFC authorization checks were insufficient to guarantee the secure execution of certain RFC function modules.
- **Enhancement**: Introduction of Patient-Authority checks provides an extra layer of security.
- **Prerequisites**: No changes are required to existing user authorizations, ensuring seamless integration without additional configuration.

**Solution**:
Implement the provided correction instructions to activate the new authorization checks. Detailed steps can be found in the Correction Instructions section of the note.
