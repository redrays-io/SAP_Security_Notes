1598308 - Connection to the SAP virus scan interface

```markdown
**SAP Note Number:** 1598308  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Release Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 13.12.2011  
**Component:** Basis Components > Basis Services/Communication Interfaces > Communication Services: Mail, Fax, SMS, Telephony

### **Symptom**
Messages that are received via the SAPconnect SMTP interface cannot be checked for viruses.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
No connection to the SAP virus scan interface exists.

### **Solution**
Implement the corrections using the Note Assistant or import the relevant Support Package.  
This enables the connection to the SAP virus scan interface in SMTP inbound processing. After implementing the corrections, the connection is inactive (the system behaves as before the corrections were applied).

Use transaction `VSCANPROFILE` to activate and set parameters for the virus scan interface. The profile `/SBCOMS/SMTP_INBOUND` is relevant for SAPconnect and is created automatically when an e-mail is received via SAPconnect in the current client after applying the corrections.

**Note:** It's recommended that SMTP messages are already scanned for viruses in upstream Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) before they are routed to the SAP system. Carefully assess whether the virus scanner can be used in SAPconnect inbound processing and use it only in exceptional cases.
