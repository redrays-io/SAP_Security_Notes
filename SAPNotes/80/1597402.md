SAP Security Note 1597402 - Directory Traversal in XX-CSC-AT

**Overview**
  
SAP Security Note [1597402](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001597402) addresses a potential directory traversal vulnerability in the component **XX-CSC-AT**. This security issue was released on **08.11.2011** and is categorized as a **Program error** with high priority for correction.

**Symptom**

There is a potential directory traversal vulnerability in the following component:
- **XX-CSC-AT**

**Other Terms**
- Path traversal
- RFUVXX00
- FI_RFUVXX00_FILE
- RFIDATAFS
- FI_RFIDATAFS_FILE
- FI_ERVJAB_FILE_PATH

**Reason and Prerequisites**

1. **Read Arbitrary Files**: Vulnerabilities in the correction instructions allow malicious users to read arbitrary files on the remote server, potentially disclosing confidential information.
2. **Write Arbitrary Files**: Vulnerabilities also permit malicious users to write arbitrary files on the remote server, which could corrupt data or alter system behavior.

**Solution**

Refer to [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001497003) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from this note are a **prerequisite** for implementing Note 1597402.

**Logical File Configuration**

- **Logical File Names**:
  - `FI_RFIDATAFS_FILE`: Program RFIDATAFS
  - `FI_RFUVXX00_FILE`: Program RFUVXX00
- **Logical File Path**:
  - `FI_ERVJAB_FILE_PATH`: Used by the above logical file names.

The application passes an additional parameter (`sy-cprog`) to the Function Module `FILE_VALIDATE_NAME` to allow customers to configure the physical paths for the logical file names.
