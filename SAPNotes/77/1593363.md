1593363 - Unauthorized Use of Application Functions in CRM-BF-WFI

**Symptom**
A malicious user can execute functions in CRM-BF-WFI without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), XSRF, CRM-BF-WFI

**Reason and Prerequisites**
CRM-BF-WFI executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The attacker may use a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to achieve this or present a malicious link to the victim.

**Solution**
1. Refer to [Note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001593363/63) and [Note 1551982](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001551982/82) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from these notes are prerequisites for implementing this security note.
2. Implement the correction instructions of this note. This will create the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_BF_WFI` in your system.
3. Execute the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_BF_WFI` and specify a corresponding transport request number when prompted. This report will activate XSRF protection for the BSP applications adapted by this note.
