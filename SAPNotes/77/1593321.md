### Description

#### Symptom
A malicious user can execute functions in CRM-PCF without authentication and authorization.

#### Other Terms
Cross-site request forgery, XSRF, CRM-PCF

#### Reason and Prerequisites
CRM-PCF executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The malicious user may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

#### Solution
1. Refer to [note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/support/notes/1520324) and [1551982](https://me.sap.com/support/notes/1551982) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from note 1520324 and 1551982 are a prerequisite for implementation of this note.

2. Implement the correction instructions of this note. This will also create the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_PCF` in your system.

3. Execute the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_PCF` and specify when requested a corresponding transport request number. The report will activate the XSRF protection for the BSP applications adapted by this note.
