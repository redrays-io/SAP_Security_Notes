**SAP Security Note 1627922: Missing authorization check in SAA_REMOTE_OP_TRANSACTION**

**Released On:** September 6, 2016  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** Basis Components > Basis Services/Communication Interfaces > Netweaver Business Content

### Symptom

An authenticated user can use the function module `SAA_REMOTE_OP_TRANSACTION` to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### Reason and Prerequisites

The function module `SAA_REMOTE_OP_TRANSACTION` does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access certain functions. This can lead to undesired system behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Due to the deprecation of the complete functionality of package SSAA, the entire `SAA_REMOTE_OP_TRANSACTION` function module has been commented out. The initiation of any operating system commands and function modules is now completely disabled within the function module.

- Implement the attached correction instructions via [SAPNote 1627922](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001627922/41) or
