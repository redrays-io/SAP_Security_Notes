1625893 - HTTP verb tampering issue in GP WSDLs

**Description**

### Symptom
In  Guided Procedures (GP) WSDLs,  there  are  problems  with authorization  and  authentication  checks  if certain HTTP methods are used.
An  attacker  can  control  the  behavior  of  the  system,  or  potentially  escalate  privileges  by executing malicious code, without having legitimate credentials.

### Other Terms
HTTP verb tampering, HTTP method, Guided Procedures(GP)

### Reason and Prerequisites
Guided Procedures (GP) WSDLs contain HTTP verb tampering vulnerabilities. This means that there is a risk  of  information disclosure  or  data  tampering  if  an attacker  accesses  the application  using HTTP requests that contain unexpected HTTP methods

**Prerequisites:**
1. Never assign `#SAP_ungranted_role` to any user.
2. Ensure  that  SAP  Note [1445998](https://me.sap.com/notes/1445998) is implemented to disable InvokerServlet  (not  required  for SAP  NetWeaver  7.20  SP03  and above).  While  HTTP  verb  tampering  and  InvokerServlet issues are not prerequisites of each other, we still recommend both fixes.

**Solution**
To correct this problem, apply the patch matching your support package version as listed in the patch table below as per the instructions in the NetWeaver Support Package Stack Guide.

Temporarily disable the affected function by stopping the following application: `caf/eu/gp/model/web`
