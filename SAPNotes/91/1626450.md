- **Recency:** New
- **Language:** English

**Description**

**Symptom**

An attacker can access active sessions in LOD-ESO-AS without authentication and authorization. This access allows the attacker to use application functionality to which access should be restricted. Furthermore, discovered information could be used to allow the attacker to specialize their attack against LOD-ESO-AS.

**Other Terms**

Session fixation, LOD-ESO-AS

**Reason and Prerequisites**

LOD-ESO-AS maintains active sessions by referencing them via session IDs. When an attacker tricks the server into accepting an attacker-generated ID that refers to an active session, the attacker can perform all the actions the authenticated user can perform.

**Solution**

Code changes were provided to address the issue. Customers should upgrade SAP SOURCING/CLM to Version 5.0 patch J, or Version 5.1 Patch 10 or to any Version 7.0 release which will include the fix for this vulnerability.
