SAP Security Note 1628709: Potential False Redirection in NWBC

**Description**

SAP Security Note **1628709** addresses a critical vulnerability in the NetWeaver Business Client (NWBC) that allows potential false redirection of content. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to perform phishing attacks by redirecting users to malicious URLs, thereby eliciting private data such as authentication information.

**Symptoms**

An attacker can publish a URL that appears to be from NWBC, which redirects victims to a URL of the attacker's choice. This false redirection enables attackers to mimic pages of the target application (e.g., login pages) to deceive users into disclosing sensitive information.

**Affected Software Components**

- **Component:** BC-FES-BUS-RUN
- **Affected Versions:**
  - NWBC 3.0 up to SP0 PL10
  - NWBC 3.5 up to SP0 PL1

**Solution**

The vulnerability is fixed in the following NWBC versions:

- **NWBC 3.0 SP0 PL10**
- **NWBC 3.5 SP0 PL1**

Additionally, NWBC now allows only connections to predefined systems by administrators. An admin can enable the `AllowTemporaryConnections` switch to permit users to connect to predefined systems or temporary systems as needed.
