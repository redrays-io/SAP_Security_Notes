1628537 - Directory Traversal in Exportability Check Servlet

**Description**
ESR support functionality allows running mass checks on objects, enabling users to specify the file name where results are stored. However, there is no validation on the file name input, allowing users to view any file on the server by using `../` in the file name.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.8
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:S/C:C/I:N/A:N

**Reason and Prerequisites**
User inputs for directory traversal are not validated. Specifically, inputs containing `..`, `\`, and `/` for navigation are not checked, allowing unauthorized access to the server's file system.

**Solution**
This patch addresses the security issues in ESR that could lead to potential security threats, such as script injection attacks via URL parameters. The directory traversal vulnerability is fixed by ensuring that input fields in the Exportability Servlet do not allow navigation through the file system using `..`, `/`, and `\` characters.

**Affected Versions**
All affected versions are fixed. To determine the version in use, navigate to the Administration pages of ESR, click on the "Software Build Information" link, and check the following:
