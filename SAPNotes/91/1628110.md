**Category:** Release planning information  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** SAP HANA Database

**Description:**

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered and subsequently fixed in revision 15 of SAP HANA.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1. **Directory Traversal**
   
   SAP HANA contains a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to write specific files on the remote server, potentially corrupting data or altering system behavior. This issue arises because the component fails to correctly validate the file path used when referencing files on the remote server. As a result, an attacker can direct the program to access unintended files, altering their contents.

2. **Memory Corruption**
   
   A malicious user can remotely exploit SAP HANA to terminate processes manually. This vulnerability is caused by memory corruption, leading the process to attempt to read outside its memory space and triggering a memory protection fault. Consequently, the system terminates the affected process, rendering the application unusable until it is restarted.

**Solution:**

Update your SAP HANA to Revision 15 or higher.
