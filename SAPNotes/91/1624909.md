SAP Security Note 1624909 - Unauthorized use of application functions in BW-BCT-CRM-RTOM

### **Symptom**
A malicious user can execute functions in BW-BCT-CRM-RTOM without authentication and authorization.

### **Other Terms**
- Cross-site request forgery (XSRF)
- BW-BCT-CRM-RTOM

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
BW-BCT-CRM-RTOM executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The malicious user may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this or present a link to the victim.
