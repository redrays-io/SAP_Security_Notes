### **Symptom**
BusinessObjects BI Launch Pad can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### **CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 3.5
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

*Note: The CVSS score provided by SAP is an estimate and should not replace your own risk assessments.*

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
Pages within BusinessObjects BI Launch Pad do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. This vulnerability can be exploited to deface or modify displayed content and steal user authentication information, potentially allowing attackers to impersonate users or administrators.

### **Solution**
Apply one of the following based on your installed version:
- SAP BusinessObjects BI platform 4 (XI4.0) SP2 FixPack20 (2.20)
- SAP BusinessObjects BI platform 4 (XI4.0) FeaturePack3 FixPack 9
- SAP BusinessObjects BI platform 4 (XI4.0) SP4 FixPack 3
- SAP BusinessObjects BI platform 4 (XI4.0) SP5 and higher versions
