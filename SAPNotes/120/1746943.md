SAP Security Note 1746943 - Unauthorized Modification via BSP SAPSIGN

**Overview**

[SAP Note 1746943](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001746943) addresses a critical security vulnerability in BSP SAPSIGN that allows unauthorized modification of displayed application content through reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Details**

- **Symptom:**  
  BSP SAPSIGN can be exploited by attackers to modify application content without authorization. This can lead to the theft of authentication information from legitimate users.

- **Impact:**  
  An attacker can deface web content, steal session data, and impersonate users, including administrators. This compromise can result in full security breaches of the application.

- **Cause:**  
  Insufficient encoding of output parameters in BSP SAPSIGN pages leads to reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
