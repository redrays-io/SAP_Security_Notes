**Other Terms**

- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- EP-KM-CRS

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Stored cross-site scripting issue in EP-KM-CRS. It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the attacker to embed content that is rendered automatically without targeting victims individually. It can also steal another user's authentication information, such as session data, potentially allowing impersonation and access with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
