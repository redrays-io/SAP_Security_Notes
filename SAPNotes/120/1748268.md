### Symptom
SRM-EBP-CAT can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Stored cross-site scripting, XSS, SRM-EBP-CAT

### Reason and Prerequisites
Catalog Pages result in a stored cross-site scripting issue.  
- It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the attacker to embed content that is rendered automatically without targeting victims individually.
- Stored cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session.
- An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.
- If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Prerequisites:**
- The latest available 7.20 kernel must be used.
- Customer must have at least SAP_BASIS 7.01 SP 10 installed.
- If the customer is on SAP_BASIS 7.01 SP 10, note 1623413 is required.
- If the customer is on SAP_BASIS 7.01 SP 11, the above note is already included.

### Solution
Implement the correction contained in this note.
