**Description**

### Symptom
Business Warehouse can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, unified rendering, BW, Business Warehouse

### Reason and Prerequisites
Business Warehouse uses the unified rendering to display reports.  
Rendering within unified rendering does not sufficiently encode HTML-OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue.  
A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.  
Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session.  
An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.  
Due to [SAP Note 1637338](https://me.sap.com/notes/1637338), changes were made to Business Warehouse in the build process. The solution proposed here ensures that the central and continuously updated library closes the security hole mentioned here.
