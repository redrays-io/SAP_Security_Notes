SAP Security Note 1953942 - Directory Traversal Vulnerability in /CEECV/ROFI_VIES_394

**Title:** Directory traversal in /CEECV/ROFI_VIES_394

**Symptom:**
`/CEECV/ROFI_VIES_394` contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to potentially write arbitrary files to the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
`/CEECV/ROFI_VIES_394` fails to correctly validate the path to which a user-submitted file is written. As a result, an attacker can potentially overwrite data in the remote system.

**Solution:**
SAP generally recommends applying a **Support Package** to install a solution. However, if you need to implement the solution sooner, you can use the **Note Assistant** and follow these instructions:

1. **Apply manual corrections** as provided in the attachment.
2. **Apply code correction instructions** from the note using transaction `SNOTE`.
3. For additional information and instructions, refer to [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001497003). The corrections from Note 1497003 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.

**Recommendations for Setting Up Logical File Names:**
To avoid maintaining a high number of logical file names, some programs share the same logical file name. This creates dependencies among these programs. To securely separate data created by different users and programs, create a directory structure that reflects the user name and/or program name. Use this information when setting up the physical path and file names for the logical file paths and file names.
