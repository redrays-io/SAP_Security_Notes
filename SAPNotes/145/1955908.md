1955908 - Missing authorization check in BC-BMT-WFM

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can call functions of BC-BMT-WFM, even though this should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Other Terms**
Authorization, authorization check, UWL, extended notification, authorization group WF_INTRN, 5W 141, S_TCODE, DYNP_FORM

**Reason and Prerequisites**
In BC-BMT-WFM, a check of assigned users is generally carried out before the execution of workflow steps, and processing is declined if the relevant assignment is missing. However, there are no additional checks to determine whether a user is permitted to call certain functions. This oversight may lead to undesired system behavior.

**Solution**
1. **Apply Support Packages or Corrections:**  
   Apply the relevant Support Packages or the corrections provided in this SAP Note to enhance the affected functions with the necessary transaction authorizations for verifying assigned users.

2. **Assign Necessary Authorizations:**  
   Assign the relevant business Workflow end users the start authorization for the following transactions:
   - `SWNWIEX`
   - `SWFPOWLWI`
   - `WI_EXECUTE`

3. **Restrict Access to Work Items:**  
   Ensure the following access points to work items are secured:
   - URLs in the extended notification e-mail messages
   - Calls from the Web Dynpro application `SWF_WORKPLACE`
   - Forms in SAP GUI for HTML invoked using the business object type `DYNP_FORM`
