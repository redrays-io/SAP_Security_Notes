1952092 - Code injection vulnerability in IDES systems

**Overview**

SAP has released Security Note **1952092** addressing a critical code injection vulnerability in IDES ECC systems. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to unauthorized system control or privilege escalation without needing legitimate credentials.

**Impact**

- **Confidentiality:** Partial
- **Integrity:** Partial
- **Availability:** Partial
- **Attack Vector:** Network
- **Access Complexity:** Medium
- **Authentication Required:** Single

**CVSS Information**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Base Score** | 6.0 / 10 |
| **Attack Vector (AV)** | Network (N) |
| **Access Complexity (AC)** | Medium (M) |
| **Authentication Required (Au)** | Single (S) |
| **Confidentiality Impact (C)** | Partial (P) |
| **Integrity Impact (I)** | Partial (P) |
| **Availability Impact (A)** | Partial (P) |

**Description**

The vulnerability exists in IDES ECC systems where the program code allows the execution of user-defined arbitrary code. An attacker can exploit this to:

- Inject and run malicious code.
- Obtain sensitive information.
- Modify or delete data.
- Create users with elevated privileges.
- Perform denial of service attacks.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Import Transport Request:** Apply the attached transport request into your IDES ECC system (applicable for releases IDES ECC 6.0 EhP6 and below).
2. **Network Separation:** Do **not** install the IDES demo system within the same network as your production environment. Ensure that the demo and production environments are isolated.
3. **Data Management:** Avoid setting up real master data (e.g., client copies of production systems) in the IDES system.
