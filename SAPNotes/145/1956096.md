1956096 - Missing whitelist check in BW-WHM-DBA

## Summary
**SAP Security Note:** 1956096  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 26.02.2014  
**Component:** SAP Business Warehouse > Data Warehouse Management > Data Basis (BW-WHM-DBA)  
**Version:** 2  
**Language:** English

## Description
**Symptom:**  
An authenticated user can use functions of BW-WHM-DBA to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information:**  
- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.0  
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P  

*Note:* SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites:**  
BW-WHM-DBA does not contain required checks against a positive set of allowed functions (i.e., whitelist) during the execution of these functions. This is required to verify that authenticated users are allowed to access these functions. The missing check may result in undesired system behavior.
