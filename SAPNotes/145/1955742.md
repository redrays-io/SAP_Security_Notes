1955742 - Potential Denial of Service in SAML2

## Description

**Symptom**

An attacker can remotely exploit SAML2, rendering it, and potentially make the resources that are used to serve AS Java unavailable.

**Other Terms**

DoS, denial of service, SAML2

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The problem is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can launch a specifically crafted request that causes the process to consume excessive resources. As a result, no other processes can allocate new resources, causing the system to be unavailable. This condition can be intentionally provoked by an attacker to cause a denial of service.

## Solution

- **Not Affected:** If SAML2 is not configured on your SAP AS Java, you are not affected by this vulnerability.
- **Workaround:** You can disable SAML2 functionality by stopping the associated web resources via deploy commands in telnet.
- **Fix Availability:** Please check the Validity and SP Patch Level sections of this note.
