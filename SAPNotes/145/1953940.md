1953940 - Directory traversal in /CEECV/ROFI_RGCBILA0

**Symptom**

`/CEECV/ROFI_RGCBILA0` contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to:

- Read arbitrary files on the remote server, potentially disclosing confidential information.
- Write arbitrary files to the remote server, potentially corrupting data or altering system behavior.

**Other Terms**

- **Directory traversal**
- **/CEECV/ROFI_RGCBILA0**

**Reason and Prerequisites**

`/CEECV/ROFI_RGCBILA0` does not correctly validate the file path used for reading or writing files on the remote server. This flaw allows attackers to:

- Direct the program to access arbitrary files, leading to disclosure of their contents.
- Overwrite data in the remote system by manipulating the file path.

**Solution**

SAP recommends installing solutions by applying a **Support Package**. If an earlier installation is necessary, use the **Note Assistant** and follow these instructions:

1. Apply manual corrections as outlined in the attachment.
2. Use transaction SNOTE to apply code correction instructions from this note.
3. Refer to [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) for additional information and prerequisites required for implementing this note.

**Recommendations for Setting Up Logical File Names**

To securely separate data created by different users and programs:

- Create a directory structure that reflects the user name and/or program name.
- Use this structure when setting up physical paths and file names for logical file paths.
