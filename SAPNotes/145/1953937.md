SAP Security Note 1953937 - Directory traversal in /CEECV/ROFIRFUVDE2012

**Description**

**Symptom**

`/CEECV/ROFIRFUVDE2012` contains a vulnerability through which an attacker can potentially write arbitrary files to the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

**Other Terms**

Directory traversal, `/CEECV/ROFIRFUVDE2012`

**Reason and Prerequisites**

`/CEECV/ROFIRFUVDE2012` fails to correctly validate the path to which a user-submitted file is written. As a result, an attacker can potentially overwrite data in the remote system.

**Solution**

As a general rule, SAP recommends that you install a solution by applying a **Support Package**. However, if you need to install a solution earlier, use the **Note Assistant** and follow the described instructions:

1. Apply manual corrections as given in the attachment.
2. Apply code correction instructions from the note using transaction SNOTE.
3. For additional information and instructions, see [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003). The corrections from Note 1497003 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.

The following logical file name has been created to enable the validation of physical file names:Â **/CEECV/ROFI**

**Recommendations for setting up logical file names:**

To avoid maintaining a high number of logical file names, some of the programs share the same logical file name.
Using the same logical file name for various programs creates dependencies among these programs. To securely separate data created by different users and different programs, try to create a directory structure that reflects the user name and/or program name and use this information when setting up the physical path and file names for the logical file paths and file names.
