### Other Terms
DoS, denial of service, SAP Sybase ASE

### Reason and Prerequisites
An attacker can trigger a condition in which SAP Sybase ASE enters an endless loop, causing it to consume all of the available processing time. This causes the entire machine to become unresponsive until the process is terminated manually. An attacker can use this flaw to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

### Solution
This issue has been fixed in the following SAP Sybase ASE versions:

- SAP Sybase ASE 15.7 SP100
- SAP Sybase ASE 15.7 ESD#4
- SAP Sybase ASE 15.5 ESD#5.3
- SAP Sybase ASE 15.0.3 ESD#4.3

Install the fixed SAP Sybase ASE versions most appropriate for your production environment.
