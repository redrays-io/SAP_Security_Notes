## Description

### Symptom

Directory traversal with read-write or write authorization:  
CA-MDG-ML contains a vulnerability through which an attacker can potentially write arbitrary files to the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

### Other Terms

Directory traversal, CA-MDG-ML

### Reason and Prerequisites

Directory traversal with read-write or write authorization:

CA-MDG-ML fails to correctly validate the path to which a user-submitted file is written. As a result, an attacker can potentially overwrite data in the remote system.  
Furthermore, an attacker can exploit an error in the authorization check to read data from the system.

### Solution

Implement the attached corrections.
