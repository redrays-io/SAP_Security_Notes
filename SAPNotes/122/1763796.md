1763796 - Hard-coded credentials in GRC 5.3

**SAP Security Note 1763796**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Released On:** February 12, 2013

**Description:**

An attacker can be authenticated to VIRSA AE, VIRSA RE, and VIRSA RAR without having their own legitimate credentials, or they may escalate privileges.

**Other Terms:**

Hard-coded, credentials, VIRSA AE, VIRSA RE, VIRSA RAR

**Reason and Prerequisites:**

The vulnerability is caused by a hard-coded username and password combination in the program's source code. An attacker who specifies these credentials can log on to the system without having been assigned legitimate access by the system administrator(s). If a user already has privileges to log on, an escalation of privileges may be possible if the hard-coded account has higher access rights than the original user.

**Solution:**

Fixes are available in the SP20 release of GRC AC 5.3.
