SAP Security Note 1769046 - Update 1 to security note 1661157

**Description**
  
Security note 1661157 has been rereleased with updated corrections. After implementing SAP Note 1661157, the activation of the program `SAPLSPML_CLIENT` fails with a `SYNTAX_ERROR` in the include `LSPML_CLIENT$02` at Line 000014 - Type `'HTTP_INVALID_TIMEOUT'` is unknown.

**Symptom**

- Activation of `SAPLSPML_CLIENT` fails with a syntax error:
  ```
  SYNTAX_ERROR in the include LSPML_CLIENT$02: Line 000014 - Type 'HTTP_INVALID_TIMEOUT' is unknown.
  ```

**Reason and Prerequisites**

- SAP Note 1661157 requires the prior implementation of SAP Note 1708665.
- Both notes cannot be implemented within the same transport request.
- The prerequisite note (1708665) must be fully implemented and activated before activating the objects from SAP Note 1661157.

**Solution**

1. **De-implement the Notes:**
   - Open the SNOTE transaction.
   - De-implement both SAP Notes 1708665 and 1661157.
   - Close the SNOTE transaction.

2. **Re-implement Separately:**
   - Reopen the SNOTE transaction.
   - Implement the prerequisite **SAP Note 1708665** first.
   - Activate the changes and close the SNOTE transaction.
   - Reopen SNOTE and implement **SAP Note 1661157**.

**Manual Activities**

**Caution:** You must perform this manual activity separately in each system where you transport the Note for implementation.
