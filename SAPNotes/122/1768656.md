### Description

#### Symptom
PI Integration Directory can be abused by attackers, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, Enterprise Services Repository, Integration Directory

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Web Pages within 'Integration Directory' do not sufficiently encode URL parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

#### Solution
This issue is fixed with the Support Packages and Patches of Software Component 'XI TOOLS' (SAPXITOOL) referenced by this note in the 'SP Patch Level' section.
