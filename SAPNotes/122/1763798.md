1763798 - Potential modification/disclosure of persisted data in GRC 5.3

### Symptom
An attacker can exploit CUP 5.3, ERM 5.3, RAR 5.3 & FF 5.3 and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands. This results in either the retrieval of additional information, or the modification of data persisted by the system.

### Other Terms
SQL injection, database, VIRSA AE, VIRSA RE, VIRSA RAR

### Reason and Prerequisites
The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by an attacker. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to retrieve additional data from the database, or to modify the data.

### Solution
Fixes are available in the SP20 release of GRC AC 5.3.
