### CVSS Information
- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Web application GUI within RA 2.5 build 780 and prior do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

An attacker can steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. This data can be used to impersonate the user and access information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution
- **Fixed In:** RA 2.5 build 781 or later
- **Up-ported to:** RA 2.6 SP07 and RA 2.7 SP05

**Additional Recommendations:**
- Stop the Websphere DefaultApplication.
- Use HTTPS connections and disable HTTP.
