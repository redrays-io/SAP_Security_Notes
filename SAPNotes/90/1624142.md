1624142 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in BC-SRV-ARL

**Release Date:** May 8, 2012

**Title:** Unauthorized modification of stored content in BC-SRV-ARL

**Description:**

### Symptom
The BC-SRV-ARL can be abused by a malicious user allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Stored Cross Site Scripting, XSS, BC-SRV-ARL.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Some BSP pages in BC-SRV-ARL result in a stored cross site scripting issue. This vulnerability can be exploited to permanently modify displayed content on a website, allowing malicious users to embed content that is rendered automatically without needing to target victims individually. Additionally, stored cross site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, it may lead to a full compromise of the application’s security.

### Solution
Implement the note or upgrade to the relevant Support Package.
