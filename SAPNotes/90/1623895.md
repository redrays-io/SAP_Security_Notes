**Header Data**

- **SAP Note/KBA:** 1623895
- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Version:** 1
- **Recency:** New
- **Language:** English
- **Master Language:** English
- **Category:** Program error
- **Priority:** Correction with medium priority
- **Release Status:** Released for Customer
- **Released On:** 11.10.2011
- **Component:** BC-UPG-TLS-TLJ
- **Component Description:** Basis Components > Upgrade - general > Upgrade Tools (SUM) > Upgrade tools for Java

**Description**

An unauthorized user can use functions of the Usage Types Viewer (technical component com.sap.sl.ut.info), access to which should be restricted.

**Other Terms**

Authentication, authentication check, Usage Types Viewer, com.sap.sl.ut.info

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The Usage Types Viewer application (technical component com.sap.sl.ut.info) is vulnerable to an attack which bypasses authentication checks for checking the identity and role of a user attempting to access its functions. This may result in an unauthorized user being able to retrieve information about the installed usage types and components in the system. As the Usage Types Viewer application does not provide any write capabilities, system availability and integrity are not endangered.

**Solution**

Apply the latest Support Package (SP) or patch of the NetWeaver Java component SAP_JTECHS for releases based on SAP NetWeaver 7.0 or LM-CORE for releases based on SAP NetWeaver 7.1 and higher, which contains a fix that completely removes the mentioned vulnerability. The fix is available in the following NetWeaver releases:

- SAP NetWeaver 7.0 SP26 (SAP_JTECHS)
- SAP NetWeaver 7.0 EHP1 SP11 (SAP_JTECHS)
- SAP NetWeaver 7.0 EHP2 SP10 (SAP_JTECHS)

- SAP NetWeaver CE 7.2 SP07 (LM-CORE)
- SAP NetWeaver 7.3 SP05 (LM-CORE)
- SAP NetWeaver 7.3 EHP1 SP02 (LM-CORE)

The fix is also available in the latest patches of the following NetWeaver releases:
