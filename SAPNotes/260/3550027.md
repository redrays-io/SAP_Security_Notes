3550027 - [CVE-2025-24869] Information Disclosure Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java

### Symptom
SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java allows an attacker to access an endpoint that can disclose information about deployed server components, including their XML definitions. This information should ideally be restricted to customer administrators, even though they may not need it. These XML files are not entirely SAP-internal as they are deployed with the server. In such a scenario, sensitive information could be exposed without compromising its integrity or availability.

### Other Terms
Information Exposure, Information Leak, [CVE-2025-24869](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord/SearchResults?query=CVE-2025-24869)

### Reason and Prerequisites
Sensitive information like metadata of the project could be accessed from the RR Browser application.

### Solution
Implement the Support Packages & Patches referenced by this SAP Security Note.

The RR Browser application exposed sensitive information like the metadata of the project. Since this information is internal to the SAP development team and should not be accessible to the customers, we are removing this application.

The other information that could be accessed by the RR Browser application, such as cache details and system information, can still be accessed by other standard WDJ applications only by the Administrator. The details are listed below:

1. **System information** - Accessible from NWA.
2. **Change number** - Accessible from the System Information page of NWA.
3. **Cache details** - Accessible from the Caches section of the Webdynpro Console application.
