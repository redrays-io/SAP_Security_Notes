3554667 - [CVE-2025-23186] Mixed Dynamic RFC Destination Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP

**Symptom**

In certain conditions, SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP allows an authenticated attacker to craft a Remote Function Call (RFC) request to restricted destinations, which can be used to expose credentials for a remote service. These credentials can then be further exploited to completely compromise the remote service, potentially resulting in a significant impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.

**CVSS Score**

- **Score:** 8.5
- **Vector:** [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The vulnerability arises due to improper access control and insufficient restriction on RFC Destinations.

**Solution**

The solution introduces proper validation of dynamic destinations. Please implement the Correction Instructions or Support Packages referenced in this Security Note.

1. **Apply the Latest SP Stack Kernel:**  
   Ensure that you apply the latest SP Stack Kernel if it contains the correction. For the list of current SP Stack Kernels, see [SAP Note 2083594](https://me.sap.com/notes/2083594).

2. **Apply Hotfix if Needed:**  
   If the correction is not available in the current SP Stack Kernel, apply the hotfix to receive the correction on short notice.

3. **Upgrade Out-of-Maintenance Kernels:**  
   Upgrade to the corresponding downward compatible kernel (DCK) as per [SAP Note 2083594](https://me.sap.com/notes/2083594).

4. **Review Regression Notes:**  
   Before installing the patch, review the regression notes in [SAP Note 1802333](https://me.sap.com/notes/1802333).

5. **Download and Install Patches:**  
   Follow the instructions in [SAP Note 19466](https://me.sap.com/notes/19466) to download and install the kernel patches.

For detailed SAP recommendations, refer to the [Update Strategy for the Kernel of the Application Server ABAP in On Premise Landscapes](https://support.sap.com/deployment-strategies-kernel-abap.pdf).

**Workaround**

Please assess the workaround applicability for your SAP landscape prior to implementation. SAP strongly recommends applying the corrections outlined in the security note. However, if necessary, you can specify the following profile parameter to completely deactivate the legacy dynamic destination:

```
rfc/dynamic_dest_api_only = 1
```

**Attention:** Consider that the workaround may have a bigger impact on existing applications than applying the Kernel patch. All applications utilizing the legacy dynamic destination will fail.
