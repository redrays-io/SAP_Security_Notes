3561045 - [CVE-2025-26658] Broken Authentication in SAP Business One (Service Layer)

### Symptom

The Service Layer in SAP Business One allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access and impersonate other users in the application to perform unauthorized actions. Due to improper session management, attackers can elevate themselves to higher privileges and can read, modify, and/or write new data. To gain authenticated sessions of other users, the attacker must invest considerable time and effort. This vulnerability has a high impact on the confidentiality and integrity of the application with no effect on the availability of the application.
