2147745 - Potential modification of persisted data in SAP CPQ Solution Configuration (SME)

**SAP Security Note 2147745: Potential modification of persisted data in SAP CPQ Solution Configuration (SME)**

**Symptom**
An attacker can exploit SAP CPQ Solution Configuration by using specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, leading to the alteration of data persisted by the system.

**Other Terms**
- SQL injection
- Database
- SAP CPQ Solution Sales Configuration

**Cause**
This vulnerability arises from an SQL injection flaw in the code that constructs SQL statements with user-manipulable strings. An attacker can manipulate these statements to modify database information.

**Solution**
To address this vulnerability, implement the automatic correction instructions which involve creating a specific authorization role and assigning it to all modelers exporting configuration knowledge bases from the solution modeling environment into ECC.

**Creating the Authorization Role `/SLCE/SME`:**

1. Start transaction `PFCG`.
2. Enter Role name `/SLCE/SME`.
3. Click on **Edit**.
4. Navigate to the **Authorizations** tab.
5. Select **Change Authorization Data**.
6. Choose **Manually** for "Manual entry of authorization objects".
7. In the popup, enter `S_TABU_NAM` and confirm.
8. Expand the hierarchy to find "Activity" and "Table Name".
9. Set **Activity** to **Display**.
10. Save and transfer.
11. Modify the **Table Name** to include:
    - `COMM_CFG*`
    - `/1SAP1/*`
12. Save and transfer, then save the role.
13. Generate the default profile.
