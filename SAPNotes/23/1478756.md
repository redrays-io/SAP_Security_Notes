### Description

**Symptom**

Due to an error in the CO summarization (or order summarization), an attacker can execute any user-defined source code. As a result, the attacker can gain control over the system and obtain increased privileges.

**Other Terms**

Backdoor, injection, run, credentials, CO summarization, order summarization, authorization

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The program code allows source code that can be determined freely to be added and executed, which enables an attacker to control the system response. Valid logon information and the authorization to execute ABAP reports in CO reporting are required.

Depending on the source code added, the attacker can obtain unauthorized access to data and change or delete it; the attacker can also change system output or create new users, and cause a denial of service.

### Solution

As of Release 6.06, the problem no longer occurs. Implement the attached corrections in advance.
