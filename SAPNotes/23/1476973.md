1476973 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in TC@NET

**Description**

### Symptom
The BSP (Business Server Pages) based TC@NET workbench for TCs could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
- XSS
- Stored cross-site scripting

### Reason and Prerequisites
Stored cross-site scripting can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the malicious user to embed content that is rendered automatically, without the need to individually target victims.

Stored cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session.

An attacker who gains access to this data could use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the applicationâ€™s security could be fully compromised.

### Solution
Please apply the correction.

**Prerequisite:**
For release EA-GLTRADE 200, basis note [1475840](https://me.sap.com/notes/1475840) is a prerequisite.
