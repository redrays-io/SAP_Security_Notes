**SAP Security Note 1478860: Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in ROS**

*Released On:* August 10, 2010  
*Type:* SAP Security Note  
*Version:* 6  
*Component:* Supplier Relationship Management > Supplier Registration (SRM-ROS)

### **Description**
A vulnerability exists in the SAP SRM application that allows a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization. This can potentially lead to the theft of authentication information from other legitimate users. The issue stems from insufficient encoding of input and output parameters in the `ROS_PRESCREEN` BSP-Page `SEARCH.HTM`, resulting in a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker exploiting this can perform unauthorized actions, impersonate users, and compromise application security.

### **Affected Releases**
- SAP SRM 5.0
- SAP SRM 5.5
- SAP SRM 6.0

- SAP SRM 7.01

### **Impact**
Exploiting this vulnerability allows attackers to:
- Inject malicious code during runtime.
- Modify or deface website content temporarily.
- Steal authentication credentials to impersonate users.
