**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error

### Description

#### Symptom

The SRM Live auction application could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

Due to a vulnerability that exists in the SRM Live Auction Cockpit application, it is possible for a hacker to inject malicious code at runtime, allowing them to steal the currently logged-on user's data and perform unauthorized actions without the user's knowledge.

**Vulnerability Details:**

A hacker can enter executable HTML or JavaScript commands into input fields and save them to the database. When a legitimate user visits a page displaying this data, the malicious JavaScript is executed, enabling the hacker to access or modify the user's data or perform critical actions without the user's awareness.

**Affected Releases:**

- SAP SRM 7.01

#### Other Terms

Security Note, Security Issue, Security Problem, Vulnerability, Exploit, XSS, Reflected cross-site scripting, Cross site scripting.

#### Reason and Prerequisites

Pages or API interfaces within the LAC application do not sufficiently encode [INPUT | OUTPUT] parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue.

A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

This is a program error caused by missing validation and encoding of user input, allowing the entry of JavaScript commands into input fields.

#### Solution

**Solution Details:**

Implement HTML encoding of input fields to prevent the system from executing HTML and JavaScript in the browser. This ensures that user inputs containing HTML or JavaScript are effectively neutralized, preventing unwanted or security-critical responses.
