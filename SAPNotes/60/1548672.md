1548672 - Freight Order: Auth. check incorrectly executed

## Description

### Symptom
The existing authorization check in Freight Order Management is executed with incorrect attributes. This flaw allows an unauthenticated user to access Freight Order Management functions that should be restricted, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The current authorization check utilizes data that may not be accurate in all scenarios. As a result, users might gain access to and execute functions on certain documents without proper authorization.

### Solution
Implement the attached source code corrections provided in [SAP Note 1548672](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001548672).
