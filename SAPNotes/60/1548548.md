**Overview**

SAP Security Note [1548548](https://me.sap.com/notes/1548548) addresses a critical vulnerability in the Business Communication Broker (BCB). This vulnerability allows malicious users to exploit BCB functions and discover related information, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Details**

- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Version:** 5
- **Released On:** September 12, 2011
- **Component:** BC-SRV-COM (Basis Components &gt; Basis Services/Communication Interfaces &gt; Communication Services: Mail, Fax, SMS, Telephony)
- **CVSS Base Score:** 7.5 (High)
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

**Impact**

A malicious user can:
- Use functions of the Business Communication Broker without proper access restrictions.
- Discover information related to the Business Communication Broker.
- Potentially escalate privileges within the system.

**Affected Software Components**

- **SAP-JEE:** 6.40
- **SAP_JTECHS:** 6.40 to 7.02
- **SAP J2EE ENGINE:** 6.40
- **SAP JAVA TECH SERVICES:** 6.40, 7.00, 7.01, 7.02

**Solution**

If you do not utilize the Java runtime of BCB, you can make the BCB application inaccessible by removing its alias name. Follow these steps using the Visual Administrator:

1. **Access Visual Administrator:**
   - Navigate to `<Server X>` → `Services` → `HTTP Provider`.
   
2. **Modify Runtime Settings:**
   - Select the "Runtime" tab.
   - Under the host screen, choose "default".

3. **Remove Application Aliases:**
   - Go to the "Application Aliases" tab.
   - Locate "bcb", "bcbtest", and "ccsui".
   - Uncheck the checkboxes next to these aliases.

4. **Save Changes:**
   - Click on the "Save Properties" button.
   - Then, click on the "Clear Cache" button. No restart is required.

After these steps, accessing the BCB application via `http://<host>:<port>/bcb` will result in a "404 Not Found" error.

**Notes:**

- **Reactivation:** To make the BCB application accessible again, repeat the above steps and recheck the checkboxes for the aliases.
- **Redeployment:** If you redeploy the `bcbici.ear` application after making these changes, the application will become accessible again. You will need to repeat the procedure to restrict access.

If you require the Java runtime of BCB, you should:

- **Upgrade:** Apply the latest Support Package.
- **Patch:** Deploy a patch with the appropriate patch level as specified in the "SP Patch Level" section of this note.
