SAP Security Note 1559558 - Potential Modification of Persisted Data in Supply Chain Management

---

### Symptom

A malicious user can exploit SCPM V1.0 and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, resulting in either the retrieval of additional information or modification of data persisted by the system.

### Other Terms

SQL injection, database, SCPM v1.0, Supply Chain Performance Management

### Reason and Prerequisites

The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by a malicious user. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to retrieve data from the database.

### Solution

Please execute the following manual steps on the concerned system:

1. **Log into the system.**
2. **Go to the Object Navigator (Transaction `SE80`).**
3. **Select "Package" from the drop-down box and provide the package as `RSC_BCT_SCPM_ABAP`.**
4. **Expand "Class Library". Further, expand `CL_RSBCT_SCPM_TRANSFER_LIB` and then expand "Methods".**
5. **Right-click on the method `GET_REPORTING_UNIT` and select "Delete".**
