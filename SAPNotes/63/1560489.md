1560489 - SAP GUI: Potential Modification or Disclosure of Local Data

**Symptom**

A malicious user can exploit SAP GUI by using specifically crafted inputs to read, write, or delete local data. Additionally, local applications can be executed.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.0
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/).*

**Other Terms**

SAP GUI, HTML control, Authorization, authorization check, Information disclosure, command execution, SAP GUI HTML Control.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The problem is caused by incorrect handling of HTML documents. Before rendering HTML files, SAP GUI stores those files locally on the victim's computer. A malicious user can compose HTML documents that could prompt SAP GUI to read, write, or delete local data or execute locally stored applications. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

We have implemented the necessary changes to resolve the aforementioned security vulnerabilities. The issue described above will be fixed by the SAP GUI for Windows patch. In the "SP Patch Level" section, you can find information on which patches contain the respective correction. Please install this patch or a newer one, as SAP GUI patches are always cumulative.

If the "SP Patch Level" section is not available or the information about which patch contains the correction is missing, this means that this has not been determined yet. In this case, please re-check this note at a later time.
