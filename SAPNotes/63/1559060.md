SAP Security Note 1559060 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content

# SAP Security Note 1559060 - Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content

## Overview

SAP has released Security Note **1559060**, addressing a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability in the **Internet Communication Framework (ICF)**. This vulnerability allows malicious users to potentially obtain authentication information and modify displayed content within SAP applications.

## Vulnerability Details

### Symptom
An HTTP request for an inactive or unavailable HTTP service can be exploited by a malicious user to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Description
The error page handling in the ICF runtime does not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. This vulnerability can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a website, and to steal another user's authentication information, such as session data. If an administrator's credentials are compromised, the entire application's security may be at risk.
