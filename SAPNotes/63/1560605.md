### Description

**Symptom**  
The "Solution Manager Implementation" (SV-SMG-IMP) module can be exploited by malicious users, allowing unauthorized modification of application content. This vulnerability permits persistent unauthorized changes and the potential extraction of authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**  
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), Solution Manager Implementation

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
Pages within the "Solution Manager Implementation" do not adequately encode input parameters, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. This allows attackers to:

- Deface or modify displayed content on the website temporarily.
- Steal authentication information, such as session data, enabling impersonation of users.
- Gain unauthorized access with the same privileges as the compromised user, potentially compromising the security of the entire application if an administrator is targeted.

**Solution**  
Implement this security note using the Note Assistant (transaction SNOTE):

1. Open the SAP GUI.
2. Enter transaction code `SNOTE`.
3. Import and apply the note **1560605**.
