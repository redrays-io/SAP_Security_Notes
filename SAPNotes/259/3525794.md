3525794 - [CVE-2025-0064] Improper Authorization in SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence platform

# Description

**Symptom**

Under specific conditions, SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence platform allows an attacker with user rights to generate or retrieve a secret passphrase, enabling them to impersonate any user in the system by accessing the target system locally. This results in a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.

**Impact**

- **Confidentiality:** High
- **Integrity:** High
- **Availability:** High

**CVSS Score:** 8.8  
**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

# Solution

The secret passphrase is no longer accessible to any user. A specific passphrase is generated in the backend for each Web Application host and sent on a secure channel without manual intervention.

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Apply Patches:**
   - Implement the patches listed in the **Support Packages & Patches** section of this [Security Note](https://me.sap.com/notes/3525794).
   - Note: Version 4.2 is no longer under maintenance. Customers must upgrade to the next version to receive the fix.

2. **Configure HTTPS:**
   - After applying the patches, configure the system with HTTPS as described in the product documentation referenced in this note, such as the [Securing the BI Platform](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BUSINESSOBJECTS_BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_PLATFORM/) section of the [Business Intelligence Platform Administrator Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BUSINESSOBJECTS_BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_PLATFORM/2e167338c1b24da9b2a94e68efd79c42?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=4.3.4) (subsection [Trusted Authentication](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BUSINESSOBJECTS_BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_PLATFORM/2e167338c1b24da9b2a94e68efd79c42?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=4.3.4)).

   - **Optional:** Configure CORBA SSL as explained in the same section [Configuring backend servers for SSL](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BUSINESSOBJECTS_BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_PLATFORM/2e167338c1b24da9b2a94e68efd79c42?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=4.3.4).

3. **Configure Trusted Authentication:**
   - If Trusted Authentication was enabled before the upgrade, follow the manual activities outlined in the **Correction Instructions** section:
     - Disable Trusted Authentication permanently by:
       - Disabling Trusted Authentication in the Central Management Console.
       - Restarting one Central Management Server.
