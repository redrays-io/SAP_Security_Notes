3537476 - [CVE-2025-0070] Improper Authentication in SAP NetWeaver ABAP Server and ABAP Platform

---

**Symptom**

SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform allows an authenticated attacker to obtain illegitimate access to the system by exploiting improper authentication checks, resulting in privilege escalation. On successful exploitation, this can lead to significant security concerns affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**CVSS**

- **Score:** 9.9
- **Vector:** [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The ABAP Server does not clearly differentiate whether HTTP communications are occurring between application servers within the same SAP system or with external servers. This ambiguity allows a malicious user to intercept credentials from internal RFC communications between servers within the same system. With stolen credentials, an attacker can craft HTTP requests pretending to be an internal caller, thereby gaining unauthorized access and escalating privileges.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability, apply the appropriate kernel patch as detailed below:

1. **Apply the Latest SP Stack Kernel:**
   - Ensure that the latest Support Package Stack (SP Stack) Kernel is applied. This patch includes the necessary correction. Refer to [SAP Note 2083594](https://me.sap.com/notes/2083594) for a list of current SP Stack Kernels.

2. **Hotfix Installation (If Needed Immediately):**
   - If the latest SP Stack Kernel is not feasible, apply the hotfix available for short-term mitigation. Download it from the [Download for SNOTE](https://me.sap.com/notes/0040000000032252025).

3. **Upgrade Out-of-Maintenance Kernels:**
   - For kernel releases that are no longer maintained, upgrade to a compatible downward-compatible kernel (DCK) as per [SAP Note 2083594](https://me.sap.com/notes/2083594).

4. **Review Regression Notes:**
   - Before installation, review any regression notes related to the target patch level by consulting [SAP Note 1802333](https://me.sap.com/notes/1802333).

5. **Installation Instructions:**
   - Follow the detailed instructions for downloading and installing kernel patches provided in [SAP Note 19466](https://me.sap.com/notes/19466).

For comprehensive SAP recommendations, refer to the [Update Strategy for the Kernel of the Application Server ABAP in On-Premise Landscapes](https://me.sap.com/deployment-strategies-kernel-abap.pdf).
