### **Symptom**
With password-based logons using the ITS (for Workplace, for example), incorrect logon attempts do not cause the user account to lock, nor is the incorrect logon counter incremented. This issue typically occurs with **RFC connections** when performing a **password-based** logon using an **SNC-secured connection**. An entry in table USRACLEXT is required for this, commonly in ITS environments.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
This problem is caused by an error in the kernel and only occurs under the conditions described above.

### **Solution**
Update to a new kernel version as follows:

- **Basis Release 4.6A/4.6B/4.6C/4.6D:**
  - Kernel 4.6D, as of patch level 1485
  - Refer to [Note 318846](https://me.sap.com/notes/318846)

- **Basis Release 6.10/6.20:**
  - Kernel 6.20, as of patch level 734
