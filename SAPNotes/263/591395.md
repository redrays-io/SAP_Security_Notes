SAP Security Note 591395: Authorization for Testing

---

**Title:** 591395 - Authorization for Testing

**Description:**
Existing authorizations in roles and profiles that contain the discreet activity '03' ("Display") no longer authorize users to execute development objects. However, if a full authorization ('*') for the activity is contained in authorizations for the S_DEVELOP authorization object, the behavior does not change because the full authorization also includes the new activity '16' ("Execute").

Activity '16' ("Execute") is already defined for the S_DEVELOP authorization object in all releases as of Release 4.0B. Therefore, you do not need to adjust the authorization object.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
Valid as of Basis Release 6.40.

**Solution:**
The existing display authorization is no longer sufficient to execute (test) development objects. To resolve this, adjust the existing roles and profiles by assigning an additional execution authorization where necessary. Follow these steps:

**a. Adjusting Existing Single Profiles**

1. **Identify Profiles with Full Authorization:**
   - Start transaction `SUIM` and select **Profiles → Profiles by Complex Selection Criteria**.
   - Select the "Active version" and "Maint. version" checkboxes.
   - Select the "Single prof." checkbox.
   - Under "Selection by values - Authorization object 1", enter `S_DEVELOP` and select "Entry values".
   - Enter `*` (with quotation marks) under "Activity" and the object type (e.g., `FUGR`) without quotation marks under "Object type".
   - Profiles with full authorization do not need changes.

2. **Select Profiles with Discreet Activities:**
   - Start a new session of `SUIM`.
   - Select **Profiles → Profiles by Complex Selection Criteria**.
   - Enter the profiles from the first step to exclude and `*` to include other profiles.
   - Under "Selection by values - Authorization object 1", enter `S_DEVELOP` and select "Entry values".
   - Enter `03` under "Activity" and the object type under "Object type".
   - Modify these profiles by assigning the '16' execute authorization as needed.

**b. Adjusting Existing Roles**

1. **Identify Roles with Full Authorization:**
   - Start transaction `SUIM` and select **Roles → Roles by Complex Selection Criteria**.
   - Under "Selection according to authorization values - Authorization object 1", enter `S_DEVELOP` and select "Entry values".
   - Enter `*` (with quotation marks) under "Activity" and the object type without quotation marks under "Object type".
   - These roles do not need changes.

2. **Select Roles with Discreet Activities:**
   - Start a new session of `SUIM`.
   - Select **Roles → Roles by Complex Selection Criteria**.
   - Enter the roles from the first step to exclude and `*` to include other roles.
   - Under "Selection according to authorization values - Authorization object 1", enter `S_DEVELOP` and select "Entry values".
   - Enter `03` under "Activity" and the object type under "Object type".
   - Modify these roles by assigning the '16' execute authorization as needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- If a role or profile contains a '02' change authorization in addition to a '03' display authorization, it is recommended to also assign a '16' execute authorization.
- Use transaction `SUIM` to determine combinations of display and change authorizations for the S_DEVELOP authorization object.
- Note that the S_DEVELOP authorization object with activity '03' only (Display) does not exclude debugging.
