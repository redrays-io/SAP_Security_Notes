**Symptom**

SAP FSCM - Biller Direct: Stopping PUT requests

**Other Terms**

SAP FSCM - Biller Direct, SAP J2EE Engine 6.20, HTTP, HTTPS

**Reason and Prerequisites**

You use the application SAP FSCM - Biller Direct. The web application was installed on SAP J2EE Engine. Since it is possible to load data onto the web server using PUT requests, PUT requests should generally be stopped. You can do this by configuring the `web.xml` file (on the application level) or `global-web.xml` (on the global level).

On the application level of SAP FSCM - Biller Direct, PUT requests are not required.

**Solution**

For security reasons, SAP strongly recommends stopping access to the web server via PUT requests.
