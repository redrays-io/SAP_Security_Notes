545334 - SAP BP: Authorization check with F4 help

**Description**

### Symptom
You want the system to consider your authorization to maintain and display only certain business partner master records in the dialog with the F4 helps for the business partner as well. Therefore, you only want to be provided master records in the selection list when you are searching a certain business partner which you may process according to your maintained authorizations. You want this function to be available with F4 helps for the business partner field as well as with the locator search help in the business partner maintenance (Transaction BP) and in the search for business partners in the CIC (here via BAPI `BAPI_BUPA_SEARCH`).

### Other Terms
BP_DIALOG

### Solution
The source code corrections are not necessary for the correct function of the business partner maintenance. The source code additions are only required if there are requirements as described in the symptom section.  
In order to be able to use the function, you have to activate the `BUPA_F4_AUGRP` implementation for the `BUPA_AUGRP` BADI.  
You as a user of the system have to maintain the values for authorization object `B_BUPA_GRP` correspondingly. The system already checks this authorization object with the actual business partner maintenance.  
You can set field group 12 in Customizing to required entry in order to ensure a maintenance of the authorization group (Field `BUT000-AUGRP`) with the maintenance of the business partner data. If the values for authorization object `B_BUPA_GRP` are maintained for you and if the `BUPA_F4_AUGRP` implementation for the `BUPA_AUGRP` BADI has been activated, the system only provides the business partner master records in the selection list of the business partner search helps (F4 search help, locator search help of Transaction BP as well as the business partner search via the `BAPI_BUPA_SEARCH` BAPI in the CIC) which you may maintain according to the values which are stored with authorization object `B_BUPA_GRP`.  
The function is available with ABA Release 6.30. In ABA Release 6.20, it is available with Support Package 09 and in ABA Release 5.0A with Support Package 24.
