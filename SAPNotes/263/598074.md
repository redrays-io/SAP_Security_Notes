### Description

**Symptom**

Full path and filename can be found on generated HTML page. This may be abused for Directory Traversal Attack.

**Solution**

Administrators should change `~runtimemode` to `"pm"`, ensuring that users only see the simplified error page without the full path. This parameter is set directly in the service file and cannot be overridden by the user in the URL.

Please install one of the following ITS versions:
- ITS 6.10 PL24
- ITS 6.20 PL5
- ITS 4.6DC4 PL462
