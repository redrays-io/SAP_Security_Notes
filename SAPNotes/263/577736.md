577736 - Users can execute programs as 'root'

---

**Description**

### Symptom

Users could execute programs as 'ROOT'.

### Other Terms

lserver, lservsrv

### Reason and Prerequisites

You are using Unix or Linux as an operating system as well as SAP DB 7.3 or 7.4. No other SAP DB or MaxDB versions are affected.

### Solution

To prevent this unwanted attribute of the 'lserver', you should execute the following command sequence for each `<dependent_path>`:

```bash
cd <dependent path>/pgm
cp lserversrv lserver
chown root lserver
chmod +s lserver
```

You do not need to stop the database to do this.

After you upgrade to Version 7.3.00.30 or higher, or Version 7.4.02.16 or higher, or  
Version 7.4.03.09 or higher, these steps are no longer required.

You can also use later MaxDB versions (MaxDB 7.5 and higher) to correct the problem, while taking the operating system into account.
