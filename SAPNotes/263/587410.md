### Title
**587410 - Test environment: Activity 16 (Execute) in S_DEVELOP**

### Description

#### Symptom
Users cannot execute any function modules in the Function Builder (transaction SE37) (as of Basis Release 6.40).

#### Other Terms
SE37, Function Builder, test environment, authorization check, AUTHORITY-CHECK.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Due to several customer requests and changes in legal regulations, the authorization check in transaction SE37 (Function Builder) has been changed beginning with BASIS Release 6.40.

- **Previous Behavior:** Users with authorization for the S_DEVELOP authorization object, '03' activity ("Display") could display and execute function modules.
- **New Behavior:** The '03' activity now only allows displaying function modules. Execution requires the new '16' activity ("Execute").

This change enhances security by allowing more specific authorization controls for executing function modules. Existing authorizations with '*' for activities remain unaffected.

Adjusting roles and profiles to include the '16' activity is necessary to restore execution capabilities.

#### Solution
If you need to implement this change for BASIS Releases lower than Release 6.40, follow these correction instructions:

1. **Change SAP Source Code:**
   - Follow the attached correction instructions.
   - Note: Support Packages or upgrades may overwrite source code changes.

2. **Adjust Profiles and Roles:**
   - **Profiles:**
     - Identify profiles with S_DEVELOP object and '03' activity without '*'.
     - Assign the '16' Execute activity where necessary.
   - **Roles:**
     - Identify roles with S_DEVELOP object and '03' activity without '*'.
     - Assign the '16' Execute activity where necessary.

Detailed steps are provided within the note to guide through the adjustment process using transaction SUIM.
