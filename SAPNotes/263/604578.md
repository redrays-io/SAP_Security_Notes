604578 - Lockout Bypass Using the RFC_SYSTEM_INFO Function Module

**SAP Security Note 604578: Lockout Bypass Using the RFC_SYSTEM_INFO Function Module**

**Symptom**

The `RFC_SYSTEM_INFO` function module returns information indicating whether the logon data used was correct, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass account lockout mechanisms.

**Affected Components**

- **Software Component:** SAP_BASIS
  - **Versions:**
    - 4.6B to 4.6D (patch level 1149)
    - 6.10 to 6.20

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The `RFC_SYSTEM_INFO` function module is utilized during the check for free resources for load balancing with asynchronous RFC. Improper handling of logon data responses can lead to vulnerabilities that allow account lockout bypass.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability, implement the following corrections:

- **For Version 4.6:**
  - Update to the 4.6D kernel with patch level 1149.
- **For Versions 6.10 and 6.20:**
  - The kernel in these versions already includes the necessary corrections.
