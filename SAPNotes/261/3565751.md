3565751 - [CVE-2025-31332] Insecure File permissions vulnerability in SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform

## Description

### Symptom
Due to insecure file permissions in [SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform](https://me.sap.com/notes/3565751), an attacker with local access to the system could modify files, potentially disrupting operations or causing service downtime. This leads to a high impact on integrity and availability. However, this vulnerability does not disclose any sensitive data.

### Reason and Prerequisites
- **Attack Scenarios**: Some attack scenarios require an administrator or privileged user to execute a modified file.
- **Environment**:
  - Reported on installers, but possible on all 4.x installers:
    - SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform 4.3
    - SAP Information Platform Services (IPS) 4.3
  - All supported Unix/Linux OS platforms

## Solution
The issue is fixed by restricting the access permissions of all other users who are outside the file owner's group. Please apply the patches listed in the ["Support Packages & Patches"](https://me.sap.com/softwarecenter/template/products/_APP=00200682500000001943&_EVENT=DISPHIER&HEADER=Y&FUNCTIONBAR=N&EVENT=TREE&NE=NAVIGATE&ENR=73555000100200006622&V=MAINT) section of this SAP Security Note.

## Workaround
- **Temporary Fix**: Change the permission of folders/files to your preferable standard for the Production environment, ensuring not to remove any write permissions on files requiring that access.
- **Note**: This workaround is a temporary fix and is not a permanent solution. SAP strongly recommends applying the corrections outlined in the security note, which can be done in lieu of the workaround or after the workaround is implemented.
