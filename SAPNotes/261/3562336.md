3562336 - [CVE-2025-24870] Insecure Key & Secret Management vulnerability in SAP GUI for Windows

**Description**

SAP GUI for Windows & RFC service credentials are incorrectly stored in the memory of the program, allowing an attacker with high privileges on the client-side to access information within the Application Server ABAP. The attacker does not need to have a user in this backend system. On successful exploitation, this could result in disclosure of highly sensitive information. This has no impact on integrity and availability.

**Other Terms**

- Information Exposure
- Information Leak
- SAP GUI
- Password in memory
- GuiXT
- Password in clear text
- SAPGUI
- [CVE-2025-24870](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24870)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

There are two preconditions required for this attack:

1. The user is logged on to an SAP System and has authenticated via username and password. When Single-Sign solutions are used, this vulnerability is not exploitable.
2. The component GuiXT is installed and active when the user logs on to the SAP System.

**Solution**

With the patch, the passwords are removed from the process memory directly after the user is logged on.

Please implement the patches referenced in this SAP Security Note.
