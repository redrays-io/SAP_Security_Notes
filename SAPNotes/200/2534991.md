**SAP Security Note 2534991**  
**Title**: Switchable Authorization Checks for RFC in FS-CD  
**Type**: SAP Security Note  
**Release Date**: August 27, 2019  
**CVSS Score**: 6.3  
**CVSS Vector**: CVSS:/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

### Description

S_RFC authorization checks are not sufficient to ensure secure execution of RFC function modules covered by this SAP Note. New switchable authorization checks have been implemented for RFC function modules in FS-CD to enhance security.

### Reason and Prerequisites

Remote calls to RFC function modules are by default protected by checks on the authorization object **S_RFC**. However, these checks may not be adequate for certain RFC function modules. This SAP Note addresses these shortcomings by introducing new switchable authorization checks that must be activated and corresponding roles updated to ensure system security.

**Prerequisites:**
- Ensure that authorization for **S_RFC** is limited to the required minimum for all users.
- Review SAP Note 2216306 for recommended settings of the profile parameter **auth/rfc_authority_check**.
- Refer to the white paper "[Securing Remote Function Calls (RFC)](https://www.sap.com/documents/2015/07/e6441a8d-5b7c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html)" attached to SAP Note 2008727 for more information on RFC security.

### Solution

New switchable authorization checks are delivered inactive by default to maintain compatibility with existing processes. To enhance security, these checks can be activated using transaction **SACF** as outlined in the detailed manual correction instructions provided with this note.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create the Authorization Scenario Definition:**
   - Start transaction **SACF** in the development system.
   - Verify if the scenario definition **FSCD_MD_IO_RE** exists.
   - If not, download the attachment [FSCD_MD_IO_RE.TXT](https://me.sap.com/notes/0002534991/D) and upload it using transaction **SACF_TRANSFER**.
   - Assign the scenario definition **FSCD_MD_IO_RE** to the development package **FSCDMAD_IO**.

2. **Activate the Switchable Authorization Checks:**
   - After system updates, use transaction **SACF_COMPARE** to activate the required authorization checks.
   - Follow SAP Note 1922808 for guidance on ensuring authorized users have the necessary permissions and how to activate the checks collectively.
