SAP Note 2527346 - Switchable Authorization checks for SAP ERP

**Overview**
  
SAP Security Note [2527346](https://me.sap.com/notes/2527346) addresses the insufficiency of S_RFC authorization checks for securing the execution of RFC function modules in Records Management and Guaranteed Minimum. This note introduces new switchable authorization checks that enhance system security by allowing these checks to be activated as needed.

**Key Actions**

1. **Implementation of Switchable Authorization Checks**
   - New authorization scenarios are implemented but remain inactive by default to ensure compatibility.
   - Activation can be performed via transaction `SACF`.

2. **Activation Steps**
   - **Part 1: Creation of Scenario Definitions**
     - Execute the report `/SAPPSPRO/NOTE_2527346` using transaction `SE38`.
   - **Part 2: Creating Productive Authorization Scenarios**
     - Use transaction `SACF` to transfer scenario definitions to productive scenarios.
     - Choose the status `Active` to enforce authorization checks or `Logging` to monitor without enforcing.
   - **Part 3: Activate Logging**
     - Ensure Security Audit Log is activated in transaction `SM19`.
     - Activate message IDs `DUO`, `DUP`, and `DUQ` for detailed logging.
   - **Part 4: Adjust User Roles**
     - Identify and assign necessary authorizations to users based on audit logs using report `RSAU_SELECT_EVENTS`.

**Affected Components**

- **Software Components:** 
  - `SAP_APPL` (Releases 600 to 618)
  - `S4CORE` (Releases 100 to 102)
  - `SAP_BASIS` (Various Releases)

**CVSS Score**

- **Score:** 6.5
- **Vector:** `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N`
