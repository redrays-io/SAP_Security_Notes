SAP Security Note 2533541 - SQL Injection vulnerability in Olingo JPA

## Symptom

*Olingo JPA query builder* allows an attacker to execute crafted database queries, exposing the backend database.

Some well-known impacts of SQL Injection vulnerability are:

- Read sensitive data, modify or delete data from the database
- Execute admin level operations on the database

## Other Terms

Injection attack, blind SQL injection, database vulnerabilities

## Reason and Prerequisites

The Olingo JPA Expression parser was escaping all the parameters in the WHERE clause, which, according to security experts, is prone to SQL injection. The implementation has been changed to use parameterized queries, aligning with industry standards.

## Solution

The fix is available in open source version 2.0.10 as well. The build can be [downloaded from here](https://olingo.apache.org/doc/odata2/download.html).
