2529480 - [CVE-2017-16690] DLL preload attack possible on NwSapSetup and Installation self extracting program for SAP Plant Connectivity

**SAP Security Note 2529480 - [CVE-2017-16690] DLL preload attack possible on NwSapSetup and Installation self extracting program for SAP Plant Connectivity**

**Description:**

_Update 18th December 2017_: This note has been re-released after adding the Support Packages & Patches section.

The most recent patches for the Plant Connectivity (PCo) releases 2.3 and 15.0 have been shipped with SAP Frontend Installer version 9.0.63. However, this installer version and all older versions have a potential security vulnerability. A malicious DLL could be introduced into the installation procedure (refer to [SAP Note 2535629](https://me.sap.com/notes/2535629) for further details).

The issue affects the PCo installers that are shipped as self-extracting archives (executable files).

**CVSS Information:**

- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 5.0 / 10
- **CVSS v3 Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

_SAP provides this CVSS v3 base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note._

**Affected Components:**

- **Software Component:** PLANTCONNECT
  - **Versions:** 2.3 and 15.0

**Solution:**

All affected self-extracting archives for PCo 2.3 and 15.0 have been removed from the Service Marketplace. The latest available patches for PCo 2.3 and 15.0 have been published as ZIP archives again to allow users more control over the extraction procedure.

**Installation Steps:**

1. Extract the content of the archive to an **empty** folder. Avoid extracting to an existing folder with content.
2. Navigate to the target folder of the extraction and start the program `SapPCoSetup.exe` contained therein.
3. Execute the installation as usual by stepping through the SAP Setup dialogues.

_Contact SAP Support if you need a specific version of PCo 2.3 or 15.0 that is no longer available on the Service Marketplace._
