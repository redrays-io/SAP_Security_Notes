SAP Security Note 2826782: Denial of Service in SAP BusinessObjects Mobile (CVE-2020-6196)

**Description**

**Symptom**

SAP BusinessObjects Mobile (MobileBIService) allows an unauthenticated attacker using a specially-crafted payload to send requests to certain endpoints. These requests can overload the impacted servlet, rendering it unresponsive. This results in a denial of service situation, preventing legitimate users from accessing the impacted component until it is explicitly restarted.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

- **Reason:** No authentication was in place for notification requests in MobileBIService.
- **Prerequisite:** The attacker must be on the same network where MobileBIService is deployed.

**Solution**

MobileBIService now validates the authenticity of notification requests. Unauthorized requests are discarded, while authorized requests have their payloads parsed and processed.

Steps to configure the solution are documented in the BI Mobile Server deployment guide. Customers can also refer to the SAP Note [2824635 - Best Practices for configuring Push Notification in SAP BusinessObjects BI Mobile App](https://me.sap.com/notes/2824635).

**CVSS Score**

- **Score:** 7.5
- **Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
