2814462 - Missing Authorization Check in S/4Hana ACR Brazil Option Features

**SAP Security Note 2814462** addresses a critical issue in the S/4Hana ACR Brazil Option where the system fails to perform necessary authorization checks for users. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to potentially read, modify, or delete SPED reports’ data, which can lead to significant security breaches.

### **Symptom**
The system does not enforce required authorization checks, enabling users to abuse functionalities restricted to specific user groups. This affects the ability to manage SPED reports such as ECD, ECF, EFD ICMS IPI, and EFD Contribuições.

### **Solution**
Implementing this SAP Note will ensure that the following S/4Hana ACR Brazil Option tools perform proper authorization checks:

- **Generate Template File for SPED Registers** (`/TMF/SHADOW_SHEET_GENERATE`)
- **Import Complementary Data to SPED Registers** (`/TMF/IMPEXL_GUI`)
- **Delete Complementary Data from SPED Registers** (`/TMF/IMPDELEXL_GUI`)

**Correction Instructions:**
1. **Pre-Implementation Steps:**
   - Create Domain `/TMF/DD_SPEDREPORT` using transaction SE11.
   - Define the necessary data elements and activate them in package `/TMF/TDS`.
   
2. **Authorization Objects:**
   - Create Authorization Field `SPEDREPORT` in transaction SU20.
   - Define Authorization Object `/TMF/SHAEX` in transaction SU21.
   
**Important:** Perform manual pre-implementation steps in each system **before** importing the Note.
