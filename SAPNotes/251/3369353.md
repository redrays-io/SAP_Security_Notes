3369353 - [CVE-2023-42476] Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in SAP BusinessObjects Web Intelligence

---

### Description

**Symptom**  
SAP Business Objects Web Intelligence allows an authenticated attacker to inject JavaScript code into Web Intelligence documents, which is then executed in the victimâ€™s browser each time the vulnerable page is visited. Successful exploitation can lead to exposure of the data that the user has access to. In the worst case, an attacker could access data from reporting databases.

**Other Terms**  
XSS, Stored XSS, [CVE-2023-42476](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42476)

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
The application does not encode special characters properly.

### Solution

The stored content is now properly encoded to prevent a successful XSS attack.

This issue is fixed in the patches listed in the [Support Packages & Patches](https://me.sap.com/softwarecenter/template/products/_APP=00200682500000001943&_EVENT=DISPHIER&HEADER=Y&FUNCTIONBAR=N&EVENT=TREE&NE=NAVIGATE&ENR=73555000100200001041&V=MAINT) section below.
