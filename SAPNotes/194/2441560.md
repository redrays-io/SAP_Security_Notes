SAP Security Note 2441560 - Potential Denial of Service (DoS) in SAPCAR

**Release Status:** Released for Customer on 09.05.2017

### **Description**
SAPCAR contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the service, thereby preventing legitimate users from accessing it. This can lead to:
- Long response delays and service interruptions, degrading service quality.
- Direct impact on system availability.

**CVSS Information:**
- **Score:** 4.5 / 10
- **Vector:** AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
  - **Attack Vector:** Local
  - **Attack Complexity:** High
  - **Privileges Required:** None
  - **User Interaction:** Required
  - **Scope:** Unchanged
  - **Confidentiality Impact:** Low
  - **Integrity Impact:** Low
  - **Availability Impact:** Low

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
An attacker with local access can prepare a malicious archive and execute `sapcar.exe` to process it. This action causes `sapcar.exe` to crash, which may lead to root access on the server.

### **Solution**
Update the `sapcar` executable to **Support Package Patch 000816** or later. The update includes proper input checks that prevent the application from crashing upon detecting malicious data segments, ensuring immediate termination with an error message.
