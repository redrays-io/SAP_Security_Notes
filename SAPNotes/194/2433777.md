2433777 - Missing Authorization check in ABAP File Interface

**SAP Note Number**: 2433777  
**Type**: SAP Security Note  
**Version**: 3  
**Recency**: New  
**Language**: English  
**Category**: Program error  
**Priority**: Correction with medium priority  
**Status**: Released for Customer  
**Released On**: 09.05.2017  
**Component**: Basis Components > ABAP Runtime Environment - ABAP Language Issues Only > Syntax, Compiler, Runtime

### Description

#### Symptom

The ABAP File Interface does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in escalation of privileges. This can lead to:

- Abuse of functionality restricted to a particular user group
- Read, modify, or delete restricted data

**CVSS Score**: 4.1 (CVSS v3.0)

#### Reason and Prerequisites

An authenticated user with appropriate business user rights may bypass access control if a file name or path name contains control characters in the range 0x01 through 0x1F, causing the authority check in customizing table SPTH to fail.

#### Solution

Apply the relevant Support Package mentioned in this SAP Note or follow the correction instructions. File names with control characters are no longer accepted, and the implicit authorization check in the ABAP statements `OPEN DATASET` and `DELETE DATASET` will always fail, raising the catchable exception `CX_SY_FILE_AUTHORITY`.

If the stricter check causes disruptions, set the following profile parameter in the instance profile to enable the old behavior:

```
abap/path_normalization = res
```
