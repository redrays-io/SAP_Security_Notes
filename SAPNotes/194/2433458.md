2433458 - Missing Authorization check in ABAP Debugger

**Description**

SAP Security Note 2433458 addresses a critical issue where the ABAP Debugger does not perform necessary authorization checks for authenticated users. This vulnerability can lead to an escalation of privileges, allowing unauthorized access to restricted functionalities and data.

**Symptom**

The ABAP Debugger lacks proper authorization checks, enabling authenticated users to abuse functionalities restricted to specific user groups. This can result in unauthorized reading, modification, or deletion of restricted data.

**CVSS Rating**

- **Score:** 4.1
- **Vector:** NHHN | U | LLL
- **Version:** 3.0

**Other Terms**

- Access control
- Authorization error
- Authorization profile
- ABAP Debugger
- S_DEVELOP
- DEBUG

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The ABAP Debugger differentiates between display and change authorization. However, the ability to execute debugger scripts is implicitly tied to display authorization. In certain scenarios, this can unintentionally leverage permissions, especially if the script performs changes.

**Solution**

The correction in this SAP Note introduces a separate authorization check for script execution when a user has only display rights for debugging. This ensures that executing debugger scripts requires explicit authorization, thereby preventing unauthorized privilege escalation.

**Affected Components**

- **SAP_BASIS > ABAP Workbench, Java IDE and Infrastructure > Workbench Tools: Editors, Painter, Modeler > Debugger**

**Support Package**

Apply the relevant Support Package as mentioned in the SAP Note to implement the correction.
