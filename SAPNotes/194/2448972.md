2448972 - Improved Permission Checks for opening connection in SAP GUI for Java

### Description

**Symptom**

SAP GUI for Java unconditionally allowed opening of new connections from an ABAP program. Under specific circumstances, it is possible to enhance already existing attacks to a broader user group.

### CVSS Information

- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 5.1 / 10
- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H)
- **Privileges Required (PR):** High (H)
- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)
- **Scope (S):** Changed (C)
- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** Low (L)
- **Integrity Impact (I):** Low (L)
- **Availability Impact (A):** Low (L)

### Solution

Please apply the patch mentioned in **Support Packages & Patches**. You must explicitly allow an ABAP program to open a new system connection. You can now define a custom trust level containing a permission for opening a new connection. The required permission is described in the error message when the attempt to open the new connection is refused. For detailed information on how to set up a trust level in the SAP GUI for Java, refer to chapter "5.1.3 Security Policy" in the manual of the SAP GUI for Java.
