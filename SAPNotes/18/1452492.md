1452492 - Unauthorized modification in displayed content Job Pricing

**Description**

### Symptom
The BSP Applications for Job Pricing and Budgeting, `HRECM_BDG_START` and `HRECM_JPR_START`, have defined target BSP Applications which are passed by a page attribute in a URL.  
BSP Applications other than the defined ones could be started by users with authorizations by manipulating the page attributes value.

### Other Terms
Cross Site Scripting, XSS, BSP, Budgeting, Job Pricing

### Reason and Prerequisites
**Reason:**  
Program error

**Prerequisite:**  
You are using the BSP Applications mentioned above.

The BSP pages do not sufficiently encode an input parameter, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Reflected XSS can steal another user’s authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data could impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the application’s security could be fully compromised.

### Solution
Implement the corresponding Support Package.  
The correction will restrict access to the defined BSP applications only.
