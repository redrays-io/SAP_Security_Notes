**SAP Security Note 1453164 - Missing authorization check in module of upgrade**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** HotNews  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** January 11, 2011  
**Language:** English  
**Master Language:** German  
**Category:** Program error  

### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functions of upgrade tools to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges. As a result, a malicious user can delete any table contents.

### Other Terms
SUGX, data integrity, upgrade

### Reason and Prerequisites
The function group SUGX of the upgrade tools does not contain authorization checks to verify an authenticated userâ€™s authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior and compromise the data integrity of the system, as logged-on users can execute any function modules in test mode.
