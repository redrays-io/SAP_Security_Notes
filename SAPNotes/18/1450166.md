1450166 - Unauthorized usage of application functionality

**SAP Security Note 1450166** addresses a critical vulnerability related to unauthorized usage of application functionalities through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF) attacks. This vulnerability can allow malicious users to execute specific functions with the rights of an authenticated user by tricking their browser into making unauthorized requests.

### **Symptoms**
- Execution of specific application functions via crafted URLs.
- Exploitation through cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or by presenting malicious links to victims.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
An unprotected application may allow the execution of certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a particular URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the authenticated user's rights.

### **Solution**
To protect your applications from XSRF attacks:
1. **Deploy the Latest Patches:**
   - Ensure you install the latest patch levels of the Software Component Archives (SCAs) available in the [Support Packages & Patches](https://me.sap.com/support_packages_and_patches) section. This will integrate the XSRF Protection Framework into your system.
   
2. **Refer to the Adoption Guide:**
   - Download and follow the [XSRF Protection Adoption Guide](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012003146900000047242010&iv_version=0007&iv_guid=6CAE8B3EAEC31ED6BD9DF95CEDC7A0C7) for detailed instructions on implementing the protection measures.
