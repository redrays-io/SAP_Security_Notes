2018190 - OpenSSL vulnerability (Heartbleed bug) in SAP Document Presentment by OpenText 5.6 / 5.6.1

**Symptom**
 
OpenSSL software deployed by customers in conjunction with OpenText Document Presentment for SAPÂ® Solutions may be vulnerable to the HeartBleed bug.

Products and applications implementing OpenSSL library versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive) and 1.0.2-beta, including 1.0.2-beta1 do not securely handle Heartbeat Extension packets. This may allow remote attackers to obtain memory dumps from SSL secured applications, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information.

**Other Terms**

Information disclosure, OpenSSL vulnerability, Heartbleed bug, CVE-2014-0160

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The insecure handling of Heartbeat Extension packets in OpenSSL may allow remote attackers to read the memory of applications which protect network communications using the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software, leading to disclosure of sensitive information. The information disclosure may include keys, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information about the secured SSL application.
