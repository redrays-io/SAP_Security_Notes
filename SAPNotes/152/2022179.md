2022179 - Potential disclosure of persisted data in XX-CSC-PT-FICA

**SAP Security Note 2022179 - Potential disclosure of persisted data in XX-CSC-PT-FICA**

**Symptom**
An attacker can exploit the XX-CSC-PT-FICA component by using specially crafted inputs to modify database commands. This can result in the retrieval of additional information persisted by the system through an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The vulnerability is caused by an SQL injection flaw where the code constructs an SQL statement containing strings that can be altered by an attacker. This manipulated SQL statement can then be used to retrieve sensitive data from the database.

**Solution**
SAP recommends installing a solution by applying the latest Support Package. If an immediate solution is required, use the Note Assistant to implement the correction instructions provided in this security note.
