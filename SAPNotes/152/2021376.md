2021376 - Potential denial of service in Afaria Server

**SAP Security Note 2021376** addresses a critical vulnerability in the Afaria Server that could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Below are the key details and recommended actions:

### Symptom
An attacker can remotely exploit Afaria, rendering it and the resources used to serve Afaria unavailable.

### Other Terms
- DoS
- Denial of Service
- Afaria

### Reason and Prerequisites
An attacker can trigger a condition where the Afaria Server process enters an endless loop, consuming all available processing time. This resource exhaustion leads to the entire machine becoming unresponsive until the process is terminated manually. Such a flaw allows attackers to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by sending crafted requests that cause excessive resource consumption, making the system unavailable.

### Solution
- **Afaria SP4 Customers:** Not vulnerable, as Microsoft protects against this vulnerability by default in MS .Net 4.5.
- **Older Releases of Afaria:** Implement the appropriate MS .Net patch for your version to mitigate the vulnerability.
