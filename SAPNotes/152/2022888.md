SAP Security Note 2022888: Switchable Authorization Checks for RFC in IS-M

**SAP Security Note 2022888: Switchable Authorization Checks for RFC in IS-M**

**Release Date:** November 11, 2014  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** IS-M (Industry-Specific Components > Media)  

---

**Overview:**

This SAP Security Note introduces new switchable authorization checks for RFC (Remote Function Call) function modules in the IS-Media (IS-M) component. The goal is to enhance system security by implementing more granular authorization controls, ensuring that remote function calls are appropriately restricted based on user roles and permissions.

---

**Details:**

- **Problem Addressed:**
  Remote calls to RFC function modules were previously secured using the `S_RFC` authorization object. However, it was identified that this approach might not provide sufficient security for certain RFC function modules within IS-Media.

- **Solution Provided:**
  The note delivers new switchable authorization checks that can be activated to enforce stricter security measures. These checks are initially inactive to maintain system compatibility and can be enabled via transaction `SACF`. Once activated, they utilize specific authorization objects tailored to different scenarios within IS-M.

- **Affected Authorization Scenarios:**
  - **ISM_GENERIC:** Covers generic functions involving customer/vendor data and FI journals.
  - **ISM_HR:** Pertains to HR integration, including reading and exporting personnel data.
  - **ISM_SD2HD:** Relates to external carrier settlement interfaces.
  - **ISM_MPS:** Involves Media Product Sales, specifically importing error lists for returns.

---

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create Authorization Scenario Definition:**
   - Use transaction `SACF` to verify if the scenario definition (e.g., `ISM_GENERIC`) exists.
   - If absent, download the required `.TXT` files from the [SAP Support Portal](https://me.sap.com/notes/2022888).
   - Upload the scenario definition using transaction `SACF_TRANSFER` and assign it to the development package `JMDGEN`.

2. **Activate Productive Authorization Scenario:**
   - In `SACF`, transfer the scenario definition to a productive scenario.
   - Choose the initial status:
     - **Active:** Enforces authorization checks and logs activities to the Security Audit Log.
     - **Logging:** Logs authorization attempts without enforcing checks, useful for identifying necessary authorizations before full activation.

3. **Configure Security Audit Log:**
   - Ensure the Security Audit Log is activated via transaction `SM19`.
   - Activate relevant message IDs (`DUO`, `DUP`, `DUQ`) to monitor authorization checks.

4. **Adjust User Roles:**
   - Utilize report `RSAU_SELECT_EVENTS` to identify users requiring additional authorizations.
   - Update user roles accordingly to comply with the new authorization scenarios.
