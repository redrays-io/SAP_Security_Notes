1498968 - Workflow definition: Missing authorization check

**SAP Security Note 1498968 - Workflow definition: Missing authorization check**

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functionality of the workflow definition tools to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an escalation of privileges.

**Reason**
The workflow definition tools lack permission checks for an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functionality. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**
Import the Support Package or implement the correction instructions. After applying the fix, the authorization object `S_DEVELOP` is checked in the workflow definition tools.
