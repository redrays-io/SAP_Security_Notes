1499051 - DBACockpit: Weak authorization checks in SQL Command Editor

**Description**

This SAP Security Note addresses weak authorization checks in the SQL Command Editor of DBA Cockpit on Oracle. The SQL Command Editor allows users to analyze Oracle performance views (V$ views, GV$ views, DBA views) and display table contents if the user has the display authorization for transaction SE16. This note introduces an additional authorization check to verify whether the tables or views in the SQL query are defined in the SAP ABAP Dictionary and checks for the authorization group.

**Symptom**

The detailed authorization check is not implemented in the SQL Command Editor, potentially allowing unauthorized access to certain tables or views.
