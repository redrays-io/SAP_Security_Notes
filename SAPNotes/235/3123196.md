## SAP Security Note 3123196 - [CVE-2021-44235]

### **Symptom**
**UPDATE 11th January 2022**: This note has been re-released with updated 'Reason and Prerequisites' information. We have made some textual changes regarding validity.

A code injection vulnerability exists in a utility class of SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP. An attacker with high privileges and direct access to the SAP system can inject code via transaction SE24 - Class Builder. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the operating system, significantly impacting the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of the system.

**Other Terms:** Command Injection, OS command injection, [CVE-2021-44235](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44235)

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The following releases of the SAP_BASIS component are affected:

- 7.00 SP32-SP39
- 7.01 SP17-SP24
- 7.10 SP22-SP25
- 7.11 SP17-SP20
- 7.02 SP17-SP24
- 7.30 SP13-SP21
- 7.31 SP15-SP30
- 7.40 SP10-SP27
- 7.50 SP00-SP22
- 7.51 SP00-SP13
- 7.52 SP00-SP09
- 7.53 SP00-SP07
- 7.54 SP00-SP05
- 7.55 SP00-SP03
- 7.56 SP00-SP01

(*) Applies if using license-bound product Post-Copy Automation (PCA). Check with transaction SAINT for add-on PCAI_ENT.

**User Permissions:**
Users must have permissions to use SE24/SE80 and execute development objects (authorization object `S_DEVELOP` with fields `OBJTYPE = CLAS` and `ACTVT = 16 'Execute'`).

**Impact:**
The compromised utility class is exclusively used for the license-bound SAP tool Post-Copy Automation (PCA) and does not affect standard functionality.

### **Solution**
**Option 1:**
No action needed if the user does not have permission to execute development objects through transactions SE24/SE80.

**Option 2:**
Implement the note using SNOTE to remove the vulnerable coding. The Post-Copy Automation (PCA) functionality has been integrated into SAP Basis for older releases/SPS, and some dependent notes must also be implemented.
