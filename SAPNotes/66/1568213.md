1568213 - PCM - Implement enhancement: Restrict Access to WebClient UI

**Symptom**
In addition to your authorization concept, you want the ability to restrict access to business roles and UI components of the WebClient UI. You seek the flexibility to define your own filter logic.

**Other Terms**
- Enhancement Spot
- Business Add-In (BAdI)

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Beyond the existing authorization structure, the PCM application can add an additional layer to restrict access from external HTTP/HTTPS requests to the CRM server. [Note 1566074](https://me.sap.com/notes/1566074) is a prerequisite.

**Solution**
This note provides an example implementation of a BAdI for the Partner Channel Management application. This BAdI implementation can restrict the business roles and UI components of the WebClient UI. Refer to [Note 1566074](https://me.sap.com/notes/1566074) for details of this BAdI.

**Steps to Apply This Note:**
1. Follow the correction instructions to apply the implementation.
2. Perform the manual steps mentioned in the note.

**Manual Step - Configure the Web Dispatcher:**
The web dispatcher between the browser and the CRM server must be configured to add the header field `x-sap-crm-external-client` with a value of `1` to the HTTP/HTTPS requests to the CRM server.
