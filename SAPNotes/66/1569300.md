1569300 - Potential Denial of Service in translation tools functionality

**SAP Security Note 1569300** addresses a critical vulnerability that could allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the translation tools functionality within SAP systems.

### **Symptom**
A malicious user can remotely exploit the translation tool functionality, rendering it unavailable. This exploitation can also affect the resources used to serve the translation tool functionality, potentially leading to system-wide unavailability.

### **Other Terms**
- DoS (Denial of Service)
- Directory Traversal
- Path Traversal
- Translation Tools

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The issue stems from a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can send a specially crafted request that causes the process to consume excessive resources. This prevents other processes from allocating new resources, effectively making the system unavailable. The attacker can intentionally provoke this condition to cause a DoS.

### **Solution**
To mitigate this vulnerability, implement the changes outlined in the [correction instructions](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001569300/41) provided in the SAP Note. The solution involves disabling obsolete code, and no further testing is required after implementation.
