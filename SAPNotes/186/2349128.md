### Symptom
UI theme designer on ABAP does not protect its applications against Clickjacking attacks.

### Other Terms
UI redressing attack, Clickjacking, Framing Protection, Framing, IFrame, UI Redressing, Clickjacking Whitelist, X-FRAME-OPTIONS, UI theme designer

### Reason and Prerequisites
Clickjacking is a UI-redressing attack where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different than the user is aware of. This attack leverages standard possibilities in HTML and does not exploit weaknesses in the application's code.

Further details can be found at [OWASP Clickjacking](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking).

### Solution
Standard protection measures against Clickjacking (such as the X-FRAME-OPTIONS header) are not suitable for common NetWeaver integration scenarios. Therefore, SAP provides a whitelist-based framework for NetWeaver technologies.

This framework and its implementation are detailed in [SAP Note 2319727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319727). This SAP Note specifically addresses the UI theme designer on ABAP.

### Manual Activities
Please update the UI theme designer to the latest patch available for your release and SP level. Information about the latest patches can be found in SAP Note: [1852401 - UI Theme Designer for SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP](https://me.sap.com/notes/1852401).
