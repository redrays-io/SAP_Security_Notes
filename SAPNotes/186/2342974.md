2342974 - Arbitrary Valid Certificate Vulnerability in Adobe Document Services

**Symptom**

Adobe Document Services uses an open-source software version – Apache Commons HttpClient 3.x, which has known security vulnerabilities. This version does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate. As a result, man-in-the-middle attackers can spoof SSL servers using an arbitrary valid certificate.
