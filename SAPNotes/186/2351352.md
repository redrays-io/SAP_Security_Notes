2351352 - The User Sessions were not handled correctly from End User Login Application.

## Symptom

If a user logs into the End User Login Application and opens any embedded application from there, then logs out from the End User Login Application, the user session was not properly invalidated. As a result, the user was able to continue performing operations on the open page of the child/embedded application.

## Reason and Prerequisites

*Note to developers – The code did not handle checking the session before opening any application from the End User Logon.*

## Solution

*Note to developers –*

- We are now checking if the application is being called from the End User Login Application. If it is, then we verify whether the logged-in user session in the End User Application is active. If active, the user is allowed to perform operations; otherwise, they are not.
