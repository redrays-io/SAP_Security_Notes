**SAP Security Note:** [1600429](https://me.sap.com/notes/1600429)

**Release Date:** December 13, 2011  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** BC-FES-CTL (Basis Components > Frontend Services > SAP GUI for Windows Controls)

### **Symptom**
An attacker can exploit BC-FES-CTL to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability allows the potential theft of authentication information from legitimate users, enabling impersonation and unauthorized access.

### **Vulnerability Details**
- **Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Affected Component:** SAP HTML Control within BC-FES-CTL
- **Impact:** An attacker can perform reflected XSS attacks to deface or modify web content temporarily and steal user authentication data, potentially compromising the entire application security if an administrator's credentials are obtained.

### **Solution**
SAP has introduced a new filtering mechanism in the HTML Control to mitigate this vulnerability. To resolve the issue:
1. **Implement Correction Instructions:** Follow the detailed correction instructions provided in the SAP Security Note.
2. **Enable Filtering:** Ensure that the `NEEDFILTERING` parameter is set when calling `load_data` or `load_html_document` methods. This allows the HTML Control to filter malicious content automatically before rendering.
