1599565 - HTTP Verb Tampering Issue in LSOCP (Content Player)

**Symptom**
In LSOCP, there are problems with authorization and authentication checks if certain HTTP methods are used. An attacker can control the behavior of the system or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without having legitimate credentials.

**Other Terms**
- HTTP verb tampering
- HTTP method
- LSOCP

**Reason and Prerequisites**
LSOCP contains HTTP verb tampering vulnerabilities. This means there is a risk of information disclosure or data tampering if an attacker accesses the application using HTTP requests that contain unexpected HTTP methods.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Never assign `SAP_ungranted_role` to any user.
2. Ensure that [SAP Note 1445998](https://me.sap.com/notes/1445998) is implemented to disable InvokerServlet (not required for SAP NetWeaver 7.20 SP03 and above). While HTTP verb tampering and InvokerServlet problems and solutions are not prerequisites of each other, we still recommend both fixes.

**Solution**
Please implement the latest support pack which is equal to or higher than the ones mentioned below:

- **LSOCP 604** → SP10
- **LSOCP 602** → SP10
- **LSOCP 600** → SP20
