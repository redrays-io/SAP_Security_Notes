**Title**
2842034 - [CVE-2019-0390] Information Disclosure in SAP Data Hub

**Description**

***Symptom***
Under certain conditions, SAP Data Hub allows an attacker to access information that would otherwise be restricted. Specifically, connections and their details maintained in Connection Manager are visible to users.

***Other Terms***
Information Exposure, Information Leak, [CVE-2019-0390](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0390)

***Reason and Prerequisites***
Every user with the policy “sap.dh.connectionsAllRead” has access to all connections within the tenant. By default, these are users with the assigned policies “sap.dh.developer”, “sap.dh.metadata”, and “sap.dh.admin”.

***Solution***
The policies "sap.dh.developer" and "sap.dh.metadata" should only be assigned in development systems. For productive usage, it is not recommended to assign these policies to users. Instead, connection access should be whitelisted by:
1. Creating a policy that provides access to a particular connection.
2. Assigning that policy to users who are allowed to access it.

To apply the workaround, update the installation of SAP Data Hub to version 2.7 or above.
