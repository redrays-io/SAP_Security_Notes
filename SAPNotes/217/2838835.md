2838835 - [CVE-2020-6190] Information Disclosure in SAP NetWeaver AS Java (Heap Dump Application)

**Description**

**Symptom**

SAP NetWeaver AS Java Heap Dump Application allows an attacker to exploit certain misconfigured application endpoints to read sensitive data without authentication. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can lead to exposure of data like Host Name, server Node, and the installation path that could help the attacker collect information about the NetWeaver implementation.

**Other Terms**

Information Exposure, Information Leak, [CVE-2020-6190](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6190)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Any information can be seen only if the system had heap dump analysis performed on it.

**Solution**

Update your AS Java to a Support Package (SP) or release where the issue is fixed. See the Support Package Patch Level section for details and available patches.

The solution disables the Heap Dump Application so that it is not started and not accessible anymore. You may use some offline tool for Heap Dump Analysis.
