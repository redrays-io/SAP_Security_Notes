SAP Security Note 2256185 - Potential Denial of Service in SAP Internet Communication Manager

**Symptom**

An attacker can remotely exploit SAP Internet Communication Manager, rendering it, and potentially the resources that are used to serve SAP Internet Communication Manager, unavailable.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 7.5 / 10

**Impact Details**

| Metric                     | Value                |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| **Attack Vector (AV)**     | Network (N)          |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | Low (L)              |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None (N)          |
| **User Interaction (UI)** | None (N)             |
| **Scope (S)**              | Unchanged (U)        |
| **Confidentiality Impact (C)** | None (N)       |
| **Integrity Impact (I)**   | None (N)             |
| **Availability Impact (A)** | High (H)           |

**Reason**

The issue is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can send a specifically crafted request that causes the SAP Internet Communication Manager process to consume excessive resources. This prevents other processes from allocating necessary resources, effectively rendering the system unavailable and causing a denial of service.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability, please implement the Patch Level mentioned in this SAP Note. Applying the appropriate patch will address the resource exhaustion issue and restore the stability of the SAP Internet Communication Manager.
