SAP Security Note 2255642 - Switchable authorization checks for RFC in Rule Builder BRFplus

**Overview**

SAP Security Note **2255642** introduces switchable authorization checks for RFC function modules in the Rule Builder BRFplus. This enhancement ensures that remote function calls are securely authorized, allowing administrators to activate or deactivate these checks as needed.

**Symptom**

Before applying this note, remote calls to RFC function modules were primarily protected by the `S_RFC` authorization object. However, this alone might not be sufficient to ensure secure execution for certain RFC function modules used in BRFplus.

**Solution**

The note implements new switchable authorization checks that are delivered inactive to maintain compatibility with existing processes. Administrators can activate these checks using transaction **SACF**. Activation involves:

1. **Creating the Authorization Scenario**:
   - Use transaction `SACF` to check for the existence of the scenario definition `CRM_FDT_1`.
   - If absent, download the `CRM_FDT_1.TXT` attachment and upload it via `SACF_TRANSFER`.

2. **Activating the Scenario**:
   - Transfer the scenario definition to a productive scenario in `SACF`.
   - Choose between **Active** or **Logging** status based on your security requirements.

3. **Adjusting Roles**:
   - Identify users requiring new authorizations using report `RSAU_SELECT_EVENTS`.
   - Update roles accordingly to incorporate the new authorization scenarios.

4. **Maintaining RFC Function Modules**:
   - Use transaction `SU22` to check and update authorization objects for the affected RFC function modules.
