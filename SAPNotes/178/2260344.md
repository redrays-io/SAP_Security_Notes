**SAP Note/KBA:** 2260344  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 5  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Special development  
**Priority:** HotNews  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.03.2016

## Description

### Symptom
There is an OS command injection vulnerability in the following function modules when accessed via transaction SE37:

- SCTC_PREPARE_CHECK_CAPACITY
- SCTC_REFRESH_CHECK_ENV
- SCTC_REFRESH_CONFIG_CTC
- SCTC_REFRESH_EXPORT_TAB_COMP
- SCTC_REFRESH_IMPORT_USR_CLNT
- SCTC_REORG_SPOOL
- SCTC_TMS_MAINTAIN_ALOG

These modules contain code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code chosen by the user. An attacker can control the system's behavior without having legitimate credentials.

### CVSS Information
- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
- **Privileges Required (PR):** High (H)
- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)
- **Scope (S):** Changed (C)
- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** Low (L)
- **Integrity Impact (I):** High (H)
- **Availability Impact (A):** High (H)

> **Note:** SAP provides the CVSS v3 base score as an estimate of the risk. It does not account for your system configuration or operational environment.

## Solution
Function modules will be re-developed to prevent execution via SE37 and to mitigate OS command injection vulnerabilities.

## Correction Instructions
Manual activities are required. Ensure you perform these activities separately in each system where you transport the Note for implementation.

### Prerequisites
If your system has a SAP_BASIS SP level lower than the listed versions, follow the instructions provided in the Correction Instructions section of this note.

### How to Do a Quick Check
1. Log on to your system and start transaction SE24.
2. Enter `CL_SCTC_SC_FUNC_POINT` as the Object Type and display it.
3. If this object exists, proceed with implementing the correction instructions.
