SAP provides this CVSS v3 base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

### Other Terms
- DoS, denial of service

### Reason and Prerequisites
An attacker can trigger an XML Entity Expansion or XML External Entity Injection. This causes the entire machine to become unresponsive until the process is terminated manually. An attacker can use this flaw to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

### Solution
The XML parser is now configured securely so that it does not allow external entities as part of an incoming XML document.

This is fixed with the Support Packages and Patches referenced by this SAP Note.
