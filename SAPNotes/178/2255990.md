#### Other Terms
Information disclosure, RTC, Real Time Collaboration, Instant Messaging, WD Chat

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Information such as user name, group name, and role name was exposed in WD chat for anonymous users when using the Web Dynpro chat application called Real Time Collaboration. When any user was using the Instant Messaging application, they could select from the list the portal group, role, or user. This information may be used by an attacker to further target the end user or Real Time Collaboration.
