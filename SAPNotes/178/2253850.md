SAP Security Note 2253850 - XML External Entity vulnerability in RTMF

**Title:** 2253850 - XML External Entity vulnerability in RTMF

**Description**

A malicious user can modify an XML-based request to include XML content that is then parsed locally. This could allow a malicious user to perform a denial of service (DoS) on the parsing system, disclose local data in the response, or access further network-located resources accessible from the parsing system.

**CVSS Information**

  - **Availability Impact:** Low (L)

SAP provides this CVSS v3 base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://support.sap.com/securitynotes).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The issue is caused by a program error in RTMF due to incorrect use of an XML parser. By default, the parser opens external entities referenced within XML input, allowing malicious content to be parsed. This can lead to the disclosure of internal resources or a denial of service attack on the parsing system, rendering application content temporarily unavailable.
