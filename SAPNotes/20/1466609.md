1466609 - Backdoor & Code Injection in Enhancement Code

**Description**

In package SEEF_COPY of the Enhancement framework, there is code that can be used for backdoor access and code injection. Although the code in SEEF_COPY is not accessible through the user interface of the enhancement framework, it can be invoked by other ABAP code. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit backdoor capabilities or execute malicious code, leading to system compromise through information disclosure, privilege escalation, or application malfunction.

To mitigate these security risks, the critical code has been removed from the package.

**Symptom**

- Presence of backdoor and code injection capabilities in the Enhancement framework's SEEF_COPY package.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

- The vulnerable code in SEEF_COPY cannot be accessed via the enhancement framework's user interface but can be exploited through other ABAP code.
- Exploitation can lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation, and application malfunctions.

**Solution**

Apply the support package mentioned in this note. An individual correction instruction is not available due to the complexity of the code artifacts that need to be removed.
