1466531 - Reflected cross-site scripting (BW document browser)

**Symptom**

An attacker can manipulate the URL to change displayed data of another user without authorization and may access the authorization data of this user. The document browser of the BW ABAP Web runtime is also affected.

**Other Terms**

- Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Reflected cross-site scripting can be triggered due to inadequate output coding via APIs in the document browser. As a result, the content of a web page can be manipulated when a manipulated link is called. An attacker can use reflected cross-site scripting to steal the logon information of the current session of a victim. The attacker can then use this information to impersonate the victim and access the application with the same rights as the user who was attacked. If the target of the attack is a user with administrative rights, all of the application data may be compromised.
