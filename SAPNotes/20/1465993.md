SAP Security Note 1465993 - Directory Authorization Evaluation Non Functional

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can access objects of Integration Directory to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an Escalation of Privileges.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Integration directory authorization lacks permission checks for an authenticated user's authorization to access some/all of its objects. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**
