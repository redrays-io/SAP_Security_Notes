### Title
**1465129 - CANCEL registered programs**

### Description

#### Symptom
This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see [Security Note 1531820](https://me.sap.com/notes/1531820).

This affects only kernel releases 31I up to and including 46D.

1. The security fix prevents a potential Denial of Service attack.
2. In addition, the query as to the number of certain registered programs is subjected to a security check.

#### Other Terms
Denial of Service attack, DoS

#### Reason and Prerequisites
This is due to the gateway design.

#### Solution
There is no workaround.

The security fix becomes active only if you implement all of the following steps:

- Apply the kernel patch that is relevant for your kernel release (see below).
- In the file `sec_info`, specify all programs that are permitted to DEregister programs that have been registered with the gateway, and treat this entry as if the program wants to register.
- Set the parameter `gw/reg_no_conn_info` as described in [Note 1444282](https://me.sap.com/notes/1444282). For the fix, the value `4` is important.

By activating this patch, the system handles the query as to the number of registered servers or the request to cancel a registered program as if the program specified under "TP" wants to register.

**For example:** One entry

```
P USER= * HOST= Obelix TP= DUDEL
```

- Allows the registration of the program DUDEL by the host Obelix on the one hand,
- But also allows the query of an external program by the host Obelix as to how often TP DUDEL is registered at the gateway and
- The CANCELing of the same program is allowed by the host Obelix.

The kernel corrections are available with the following patch level for 31I - 46D:

- 31I patch level 785
- 40B patch level 1074
- 45B patch level 1005
- 46D PL 2530
