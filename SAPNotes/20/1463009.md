1463009 - Hard coded credentials in report /RPM/TEST_FRONT_END.

## Overview

**SAP Security Note 1463009** addresses a critical vulnerability in the report `/RPM/TEST_FRONT_END`. This issue involves hard-coded credentials that can alter the program's behavior when a specific username is used for authentication. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to authenticate without legitimate credentials, potentially escalating privileges within the system.

## Symptom

The report `/RPM/TEST_FRONT_END` contains code that changes the program's behavior when a user successfully authenticates with a certain username. This allows a malicious user to authenticate without their own legitimate credentials, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

## Other Terms

- **Test front end**
- **Backdoor**
- **Hard-coded credentials**
- **/RPM/TEST_FRONT_END**

## Reason and Prerequisites

The vulnerability arises from a hard-coded username-password combination in the program's source code. This allows a malicious user to log into the system without having been assigned legitimate access by system administrators. If the hard-coded account has higher access rights than the original user, an escalation of privileges may occur.

## Solution

Implement the source code changes provided in SAP Note 1463009 to eliminate the hard-coded credentials and secure the authentication process.
