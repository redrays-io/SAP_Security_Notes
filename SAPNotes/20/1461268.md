### Symptom
When trying to visualize a WSDL corresponding to a web service by opening its URL, in certain error situations the returned error message may cause a vulnerability by disclosing file system paths on the server.

### Reason and Prerequisites
If the WSDL visualizer fails to load a WSDL file, the error message includes the server's file system path to the WSDL file. This information can be exploited by malicious users to gain insights into the server's directory structure.
