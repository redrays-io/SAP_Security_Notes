2917022 - [CVE-2020-6250] Information Disclosure in SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise

## Symptom
SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise allows an authenticated attacker to exploit certain misconfigured endpoints exposed over the adjacent network to read system administrator passwords, leading to Information Disclosure. This could enable the attacker to read/write any data and even stop the server with administrative privileges.

## Impact
- **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized access to system administrator passwords.
- **Data Manipulation**: Ability to read and write any data within the system.
- **Service Disruption**: Potential to stop the server, causing downtime.

## Affected Versions
- **Product Version**: SAP ASE 16.0 SP03 prior to PL08 HF1
- **Software Components**: 
  - SYBASE_ASE_SERVER from version 16.0 to 16.0

## CVSS Details
- **CVSS Score**: 6.8
- **CVSS Vector**: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  - **Attack Vector**: Adjacent (A)
  - **Attack Complexity**: Low (L)
  - **Privileges Required**: High (H)
  - **User Interaction**: None (N)
  - **Scope**: Unchanged (U)
  - **Confidentiality Impact**: High (H)
  - **Integrity Impact**: High (H)
  - **Availability Impact**: High (H)

## Reason and Prerequisites
SAP ASE writes sensitive information into log files accessible only by privileged users. However, leveraging another vulnerability to access the filesystem, an attacker can obtain this sensitive information. **SAP ASE on Windows platforms is not affected**.

## Solution
This issue has been fixed in **SAP ASE 16.0 SP03 PL08 HF1**. It is recommended to:

1. **Upgrade** to SAP ASE 16.0 SP03 PL08 HF1 or later.
2. Ensure that all releases subsequent to the fixed version inherit the described fixes.
