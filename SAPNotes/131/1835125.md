1835125 - Untrusted XML input parsing possible in sapxmltoolkit

**Symptom**

A malicious user can modify an XML-based request to include XML content that is then parsed locally. This could allow a malicious user to perform a denial of service (DoS) on the parsing system, disclose local data that is returned in the response to the malicious request, or access further network-located resources accessible from the parsing system.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.0
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

_SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. It does not account for your system configuration or operational environment. Conduct your own risk assessments when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://me.sap.com/service.sap.com/securitynotes/) at SAP Security Notes._

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The issue is caused by a program error in sapxmltoolkit due to the incorrect use of an XML parser. By default, the parser opens external entities referenced within an XML input, potentially allowing malicious content to be parsed. This malicious content can reference internal resources, such as files, which may be disclosed in the response or used to perform a denial of service attack, rendering application content temporarily unavailable.

**Solution**

Update the SAP Java AS according to the [note validity table](https://me.sap.com/notes/1835125).
