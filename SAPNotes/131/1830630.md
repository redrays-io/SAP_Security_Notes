1830630 - Unauthorized modification in BSP application in IS-HER-CM

**Symptom**
IS-HER-CM can be exploited by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability may allow attackers to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Impact**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability arises because BSP Pages `DEFAULT.HTM` within IS-HER-CM do not adequately encode OUTPUT parameters.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal authentication details, such as session data, enabling them to impersonate users.
- **Security Compromise:** If an administrator's credentials are compromised, the entire application's security may be breached.
