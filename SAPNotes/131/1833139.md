### Description

#### Symptom
XI3.1 Performance Management can be used for phishing attacks by allowing an attacker to publish a URL purporting to be from the product, which redirects the victim to a URL chosen by the attacker. This enables an attacker to falsely gain the trust of a victim and elicit private data from them (such as authentication information).

**CVSS Information**  
CVSS Base Score: 4.3  
CVSS Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/) at SAP Security Notes.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Some pages within Performance Management enable a cross-domain redirection to occur. An attacker can include a URL from a different domain in a URL of the target application, which can then be sent to a user of the target application. The user thinks that the content is from the target application, but when they visit such a page, the content is delivered from the domain chosen by the attacker. The attacker can then mimic pages of the target application (for example, a logon page) to get the victim to disclose information they would not otherwise reveal to the attacker (such as their password).

**Mitigation:** Restrict redirections to relative or local domains only.

#### Solution
Issue is resolved in the following Support Packages:
- XI3.1 SP5 FP5
- XI3.1 SP6 FP1
- XI3.1 SP7 onward

It is not relevant for BI4.0.
