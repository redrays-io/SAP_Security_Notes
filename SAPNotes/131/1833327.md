1833327 - Potential disclosure of persisted data in BC-SRV-ADR

**SAP Security Note 1833327** addresses a critical SQL injection vulnerability within the **BC-SRV-ADR** component of **SAP_BASIS**. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit address master data by injecting specially crafted inputs, modifying database commands, and retrieving additional persisted information from the system.

### Symptom
An attacker can exploit address master data and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, resulting in the retrieval of additional information persisted by the system.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The issue stems from an SQL injection vulnerability where the code constructs SQL statements using strings that can be manipulated by an attacker. This manipulation enables the retrieval of unauthorized data from the database.

### Solution
Implement the code corrections provided in [SAP Note 1833327](https://me.sap.com/notes/1833327) to mitigate the SQL injection risk.
