1833485 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BIW

**Symptom**

BI4.0 BI Workspaces can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment.

**Other Terms**

Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, BI Workspaces, XI4.0

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages within BI Workspaces do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Fixed in the following Support Packages and Patches:

- XI4.0 Patch5.6
- XI4.0 Patch6.1
- XI4.0 SP7 onward
