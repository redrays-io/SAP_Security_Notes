The updated clients are available on [Google Play](https://me.sap.com/google-play), the [Apple App Store](https://me.sap.com/apple-app-store), the [Afaria signing portal](https://me.sap.com/afaria-signing-portal), and the [SAP Mobile Secure Cloud signing portal](https://me.sap.com/sap-mobile-secure-cloud-signing-portal). SAP strongly recommends that customers instruct their SAP Afaria users to prioritize updating the mobile device app.

Additionally, a hotfix (**Afaria 7.0 SP4 HF7**) has been provided for the SAP Afaria server to ensure that affected mobile devices are updated before any further device enrollment can occur. It is recommended that customers first apply the hotfix on their SAP Afaria server, then instruct users to download the latest SAP Afaria app from the appropriate app store and change their active directory credentials.

SAP takes all security-related reports seriously and will notify customers as relevant new information becomes available. Customers may also contact SAP support by raising a customer incident on component [MOB-AFA](https://me.sap.com/mob-afa-support).
