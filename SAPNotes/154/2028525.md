SAP Security Note 2028525 - Missing Authorization Check in FI-LA

**Description**

SAP Security Note [2028525](https://me.sap.com/notes/2028525) addresses a critical security vulnerability in the FI-LA (Financial Accounting - Lease Accounting Engine) component. The function module `FILA_PRODUCT_READ` lacks a supplementary authorization check, potentially allowing unauthorized access and compromising system security.

**Symptom**

The function module `FILA_PRODUCT_READ` does not perform the necessary authorization checks, which may allow users to execute operations without the required permissions.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Remote calls to RFC function modules are typically protected by the authorization object `S_RFC`. However, in this case, `FILA_PRODUCT_READ` might not sufficiently enforce authorization checks, leading to potential security breaches. It's essential to ensure that authorizations for `S_RFC` are tightly controlled and that additional functional authorization checks are implemented where necessary.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability, apply the correction instructions provided in the security note. The steps include:

1. **Apply Correction Instructions:**
   - Download the correction package from [Download for SNOTE](https://notesdownloads.sap.com/note/0040000012058932017).
   - Follow the manual activities outlined in the note to implement the necessary authorization checks.

2. **Manual Activities:**
   - Execute transaction SE91 ("Message Maintenance") in your SAP system.
   - Create a new message number 421 in the message class `FILAE` with the text: `'No authorization for company code &1'`.
   - Ensure the "Self-Explanatory" flag is checked.
   - Adjust user roles to include the authorization object `F_L_ACCRUL` with the necessary fields (`COMPONENT: 'FILA'`, and appropriate `BUKRS`, `ACTVT` values).

**Affected Components**

- **Software Component:** EA-APPL
