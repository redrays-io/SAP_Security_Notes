SAP Security Note 2030657: Switchable authorization checks for RFC in PSM-GPR

---

**Title:** Switchable authorization checks for RFC in PSM-GPR  
**Number:** 2030657  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Released On:** August 1, 2018  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** Public Sector Management > Procurement for Public Sector

### Description
This SAP note introduces new switchable authorization checks for RFC function modules within the Procurement for Public Sector (PSM-GPR) component. These checks enhance the security framework by providing additional layers of authorization to ensure that RFC calls are executed securely.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Remote Function Calls (RFC) to function modules are typically secured using the authorization object **S_RFC**. However, it has been identified that relying solely on **S_RFC** might not suffice for certain RFC function modules covered by this note. To address potential security gaps, new authorization checks have been developed.

**Prerequisites:**
- Ensure that the RFC function modules affected by this note are included in your **S_RFC** authorizations.
- Review [SAP Note 2008727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2008727) for additional information on RFC security best practices.

### Solution
The solution involves activating the newly implemented switchable authorization checks. These checks are initially delivered in an inactive state to maintain compatibility with existing processes. Administrators should:

1. Activate the new authorization checks.
2. Update the corresponding user roles to incorporate the new authorization requirements.

This ensures that RFC function modules have enhanced security without disrupting current operations.
