2027797 - Missing Authority Check in Mobile Defense RFC function modules

## Symptom
Several RFC Function Modules in MDS Backend require supplementary authorization check to ensure better security.

## Other Terms
RFC, authorization, MDS, `/ISDFPS/ME_PM_ARBPL_REL_GETLIS`, `/ISDFPS/ME_PM_M_CRAMA_GETLIST`, `/ISDFPS/PM_MPL_NODE_GETDETAIL`, `/ISDFPS/PM_MPL_NODE_GETLIST`, `/ISDFPS/PM_MPL_NODE_TEXT_GL`, `/ISDFPS/PM_MPL_VAR_GETLIST`, `/ISDFPS/PM_MPL_VAR_TEXT_GL`

## Reason and Prerequisites
Remote calls to RFC function modules are protected by checks on the authorization object S_RFC. Authorizations for S_RFC must be limited to the required minimum authorizations for all users to ensure system security. Many RFC function modules can be sufficiently protected using S_RFC authorization checks. These RFC function modules often do not perform additional functional authorization checks. Please see [SAP note 2008727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2008727) for further information on RFC Security.

It was identified that S_RFC authorization checks might not be sufficient to ensure secure execution for RFC function modules covered by this note.

## Solution
Implement the attached correction instruction in order to fix the authorization check gap. You can download the correction via [Download for SNOTE](https://notesdownloads.sap.com/note/0040000012054942017) or view the [PDF Version](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sfm/notes/print/0002027797?language=en-US&token=38ABDAF5CE0F249B3ACB927AB0CB6413).

**Manual Activities:**
- Perform the manual post-implementation steps in each system after importing the Note.
- Adjust user roles to provide necessary authorizations.
- Update the following RFC function modules with the specified authorization objects and parameters:
  - `/ISDFPS/ME_PM_ARBPL_REL_GETLIS` – `DF_ME_NAV=PM`, `ACVTC=03`
  - `/ISDFPS/ME_PM_M_CRAMA_GETLIST` – `DF_ME_NAV=PM`, `ACVTC=03`
  - `/ISDFPS/PM_MPL_NODE_GETDETAIL` – `DF_ME_NAV=PM`, `ACVTC=03`
  - `/ISDFPS/PM_MPL_NODE_GETLIST` – `DF_ME_NAV=PM`, `ACVTC=03`
  - `/ISDFPS/PM_MPL_NODE_TEXT_GL` – `DF_ME_NAV=PM`, `ACVTC=03`
  - `/ISDFPS/PM_MPL_VAR_GETLIST` – `DF_ME_NAV=PM`, `ACVTC=03`
  - `/ISDFPS/PM_MPL_VAR_TEXT_GL` – `DF_ME_NAV=PM`, `ACVTC=03`
