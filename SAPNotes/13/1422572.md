1422572 - Unauthorized change of displayed contents

## Description

### Symptom
An attacker can manipulate certain input parameters in the Web service infrastructure to change the displayed data of another user without authorization and may access the authorization data of this user.

### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS

### Reason and Prerequisites
Since output is not sufficiently coded in the class `CL_HTTP_EXT_FORMTORFC`, reflected cross-site scripting may be triggered. As a result, the content of a Web page can be manipulated when a manipulated link is called, for example.

An attacker can use reflected cross-site scripting to steal the logon information of the current session of the victim. The attacker can then use this information to pretend to the server that they are the victim and can use the application with the same rights as the user who was attacked.

If the target of the attack is a user with administrative rights, all of the application data may be compromised as a result.
