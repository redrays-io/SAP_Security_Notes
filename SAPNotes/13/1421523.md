## Description

### Symptom

- After applying the respective service packs listed below, the examples originally shipped with the J2EE engine are no longer available.
- Possible path traversal with shipped examples.

### Other Terms

example applications, j2ee engine

### Reason and Prerequisites

The example applications which were originally shipped with the Engine provided demonstrations for basic J2EE functionality.

The scenarios covered by the example applications have been revised and enriched by more versatile samples that are closer to real usage and do not contain the security issues (related to possible path traversal) present in the previously shipped examples.

These new examples are shipped with the NetWeaver Developer Studio and can be built and deployed from it.

The example applications have been deleted from the Engine packages in the following versions:

- SAP J2EE Engine 6.40 - SP 20
- SAP J2EE Engine 7.00 - SP 22
- SAP J2EE Engine 7.01 - SP 07
- SAP J2EE Engine 7.02 - SP 03

### Solution

Undeploy the examples that come with the Engine and use the examples in the NetWeaver Developer Studio.

It is strongly recommended to undeploy (if deployed) the following applications:

- Calculator
- Servlet Filter
- Hello
- Increment
- JavaMailExamples
- MDB
- Shop
