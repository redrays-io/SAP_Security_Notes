SAP Security Note 1591813 - Potential disclosure of persisted data in test code

**SAP Security Note 1591813** addresses a critical security vulnerability related to the potential disclosure of persisted data in test code within the SAP system. Below is a summary of the key information from the note:

---

### **Symptom**
A malicious user can exploit a function module originally intended for testing purposes by using specially crafted inputs. This exploitation allows the user to modify database commands, resulting in the retrieval of additional information that the system has persisted.

### **Other Terms**
- **SQL Injection**
- **Database**

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The vulnerability arises from an SQL injection flaw. The problematic code constructs an SQL statement incorporating strings that can be manipulated by a malicious user. This altered SQL statement can then be used to extract data from the database, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.

### **Solution**
Apply the recommended corrections provided in the security note. Specifically, implement the following steps:

1. **Correction Call Transaction SE37:**
   - Enter the function module name `CATT_ATTRIBUTE_SELECT`.
   - Click on **Change**.
   
2. **Modify the Function Module:**
   - Comment out the entire code of the function module up to the statement `ENDFUNCTION`.
   - Save and activate the function module.

**Note:** For releases 3.1I to 4.5, automated note implementation is not possible. The above manual steps are required to mitigate the vulnerability.
