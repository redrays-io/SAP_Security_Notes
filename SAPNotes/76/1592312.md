1592312 - Code injection vulnerability in EC-EIS

### Symptom
RKC_FUNCTION_INTERFACE_GEN contains code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice. A malicious user can therefore control the behavior of the system or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without having their own legitimate credentials.

### CVSS Information
- **CVSS Base Score:** 3.5
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N

*Note:* SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue. This estimate does not consider your system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace your own risk assessments when determining the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/) on the SAP Service site.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The program code allows the definition and execution of user-defined code that changes the system's behavior. A valid and authenticated user with authorization to call an RFC module is required. Depending on the code, the user can:
- Inject and run their own code
- Obtain additional information that should not be displayed
- Modify or delete data
- Modify the system's output
- Create new users with higher privileges
- Perform a denial of service attack

### Solution
Implement the attached corrections provided in this security note.
