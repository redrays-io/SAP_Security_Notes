SAP Note 1592256 - Unauthorized use of application functions in CRM

**Symptom**
A malicious user can execute functions in CRM-MKT-ISM, CRM-ISE, CRM-MD-PCT, CRM-ISA, CRM-ANA-PS, and CRM-MD-PRO without authentication and authorization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and manipulation of critical CRM functionalities.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
CRM-MKT-ISM, CRM-ISE, CRM-MD-PCT, CRM-ISA, CRM-ANA-PS, and CRM-MD-PRO execute certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a specific URL and parameters, the function is executed with the user's rights. This can be achieved through cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or by presenting a deceptive link to the victim.

**Solution**
1. **Obsolete BSP Applications**: The following BSP applications are obsolete as of several releases. SAP has updated them to enhance security, and they should no longer be used:
   - CRM_MKTISM_TEST
   - ICSS_CONSUM_REG
   - COM_PCAT_IMSD_REPL_SHOW
   - CRM_ISA_AGENT
   - CRM_KPI_DEMO
   - COM_BSP_IO_MAP
   - CRM_PRODUCT_GETLIST

2. **Prerequisite Notes**: Refer to [SAP Note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324) and [SAP Note 1551982](https://me.sap.com/notes/1551982) for additional information and instructions. Implementing the corrections from these notes is a prerequisite for applying SAP Note 1592256.

3. **Implement Correction Instructions**: Follow the correction instructions provided in this note. This will create the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_CRM_VARIOUS` in your system.

4. **Execute the Report**: Run the report `BSP_XSRF_PARAM_VARIOUS` and specify a transport request number when prompted. This action will activate XSRF protection for the adapted BSP applications.
