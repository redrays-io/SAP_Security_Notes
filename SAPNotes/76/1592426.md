1592426 - PI SEC: Unauthorized use of administrative functions in PI

### Symptom
A malicious user can execute functions in NW PI Adapter Framework without authentication and authorization.

### Other Terms
Cross-site request forgery, XSRF, Adapter Framework, CPA Cache, Mapping Runtime

### Reason and Prerequisites
PI Adapter Framework executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The malicious user may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

As part of the changes, the ABAP role `SAP_XI_ID_SERV_USER` was enhanced with the authorization object `S_ICF` and attributes `ICF_FIELD=SERVICE`, `ICF_VALUE=XICACHE`.

### Solution
This issue is fixed with the referenced Support Packages and Patches of the following Software Components:
- **XI ADAPTER FRAMEWORK** (SAP_XIAF)
- **XI TOOLS** (SAPXITOOL)
- **SAP_BASIS**
