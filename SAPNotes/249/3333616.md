3333616 - [CVE-2023-37487] Security Misconfiguration vulnerability in SAP Business One (Service Layer)

**Symptom**

SAP Business One Service Layer allows an authenticated attacker with deep knowledge to perform certain operations to access unintended data over the network, which could lead to a high impact on confidentiality with no impact on integrity and availability of the application.

**Other Terms**

Information disclosure, mobile users, [CVE-2023-37487](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37487)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The vulnerability may occur only if you are working in a SAP Business One environment with multiple company databases using one database instance of the SAP Business One Cloud environment.

There are many users from different companies simultaneously logging into their company through the SAP Business One Service Layer.

**Solution**

SAP B1 has addressed the problem in the service layer to better isolate the tenants and sessions.

The solution has been released in **2208HF2**.

The patches can be found on the [SAP ONE Support Launchpad](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/softwarecenter).

This is a random occurrence arising from the specific scenario described above.

**Workaround:**

Please assess the applicability of the workaround for your SAP landscape prior to implementation.

> **Note:** This workaround is a temporary fix and not a permanent solution. SAP strongly recommends applying the corrections outlined in the security note, which can be done instead of the workaround or after the workaround is implemented.

1. Select one node (e.g., node 1 listening on port 50001) specific for login requests.
2. Set this node in hot spare status to prevent it from receiving non-login requests.
3. Limit the concurrent capability of the node by changing the worker number to a small value (e.g., 1 or 2) so that login requests will be handled sequentially.
4. Leave the other nodes unchanged so they continue to receive non-login requests.
