**Workaround**

Assess the applicability of the workaround for your SAP landscape prior to implementation. Note that this workaround is a temporary fix and not a permanent solution. SAP strongly recommends applying the corrections outlined in the security note, either instead of the workaround or after implementing it.

As a workaround, you can manually empty report `RSCTS_OBJ_TRACK_BENCHMARK_PREP` if the note is not applicable. To do this, remove all code lines starting at line 10 from the report `RSCTS_OBJ_TRACK_BENCHMARK_PREP`, save and activate the update, and then transport it to your landscape. However, it is recommended to apply the provided corrections.
