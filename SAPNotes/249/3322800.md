---

**Description**

This security note supplements the fix provided in [SAP Note 3315971](https://me.sap.com/notes/3315971) and should be implemented for a complete resolution.

**Vulnerability Details**

SAP CRM (WebClient UI) does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker could store a malicious URL and lure a victim to click it, causing the attacker-supplied script to execute in the victim user's session. This could allow the attacker to modify or read information from the victim's session.

**Solution**

- **Input Encoding:** User inputs are now properly encoded to prevent successful XSS attacks.
- **Implementation:** Apply the correction instructions or install the support packages referenced by this note.
