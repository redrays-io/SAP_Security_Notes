**Title**
2280371 - Directory Traversal Vulnerability in a Telnet Command

**Description**
### Symptom

One of the telnet commands allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of path information provided by users, thus characters representing ‘traverse to parent directory’ are passed through to the file APIs.

Some well-known impacts of the directory traversal vulnerability are the following:
- An attacker could read content of arbitrary files on the remote server and expose sensitive data.
- An attacker could overwrite, delete, or corrupt arbitrary files on the remote server.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS v3 Base Score**: 3.4 / 10
