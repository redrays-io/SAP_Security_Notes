SAP Security Note 2280054: Information Disclosure in Data Provisioning Agent

**SAP Security Note 2280054: Information Disclosure in Data Provisioning Agent**

**Overview**
- **Note Number:** 2280054
- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Released On:** April 12, 2016
- **Component:** SAP HANA smart data integration (SDI)
- **Priority:** Correction with medium priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer

**Symptom**
Under certain conditions, the Data Provisioning Agent host delivered to the HANA database server allows an attacker to access information that should otherwise be restricted. This can lead to:
- Loss of information and system configuration confidentiality
- Information gathering for further exploits and attacks

**CVSS Information**
- **Base Score:** 5.3 / 10
- **Vector:**
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
  - **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
  - **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)
  - **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)
  - **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)
  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** Low (L)
  - **Integrity Impact (I):** None (N)
  - **Availability Impact (A):** None (N)

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Information such as installed adapters, their versions, landscape configuration data, and other internal information of the Data Provisioning Agent host can be discovered. This information may be used by an attacker to further target the Data Provisioning Agent.

**Solution**
Enable SSL for the Data Provisioning Agent to prevent information disclosure. SSL is not enabled by default. Follow the instructions in the [SAP HANA Enterprise Information Management Administration Guide](https://me.sap.com/) to enable SSL.

Starting from release HANA DP Agent 1.0 SP01 Patch 3, a warning message will be displayed during installation to alert users to enable SSL.
