2290512 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in BI Platform and BI Launch Pad

---

**Description**

**Symptom**

SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (BI) 4.0 and BI Launch Pad (BILP) do not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This can lead to:

- Non-permanently defacing or modifying displayed content on a website.
- Stealing authentication information of the user, such as session data.
- Impersonating the user to access information with the same rights as the target user.
