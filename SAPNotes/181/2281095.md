2281095 - Missing authorization check in ECTR

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functions of ECTR to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
ECTR does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's permissions to access certain functions. This omission may lead to undesired system behavior.

**Solution**
Implement this SAP Security Note to enforce proper authorization checks within ECTR.
