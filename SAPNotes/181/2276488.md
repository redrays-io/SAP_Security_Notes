2276488 - Missing authorization check in CRM-IC-HCM

**SAP Note 2276488** addresses missing authorization checks in the CRM-IC-HCM component of the SAP system. This security note ensures that unauthorized access via RFC function modules is prevented by implementing proper authorization objects.

### Symptom

This note introduces new authorization checks for the following RFC function modules in the HCM Shared Service Framework:

- `CRM_IC_SSC_FILL_PA_INFO`
- `CRM_IC_SSC_CHKLIST_STEP_COMPLT`
- `CRM_IC_SSC_EC_SWITCH_STATUS`

### Reason and Prerequisites

Remote calls to RFC function modules are protected by checks on the authorization object `S_RFC`. However, it was identified that these checks might not be sufficient to ensure secure execution for the mentioned function modules.

### Solution

Ensure that the proper user authorizations are maintained for the following function modules:

| Function Module                    | Auth. Object | Param1  |
|------------------------------------|--------------|---------|
| CRM_IC_SSC_FILL_PA_INFO            | CRM_ORD_OP   | ACTVT=03 |
| CRM_IC_SSC_CHKLIST_STEP_COMPLT     | CRM_ORD_OP   | ACTVT=03 |
| CRM_IC_SSC_EC_SWITCH_STATUS        | CRM_ORD_OP   | ACTVT=03 |
