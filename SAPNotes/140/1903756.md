SAP Security Note 1903756 - DB6: Authorization to execute operating system commands

---

**SAP Security Note 1903756 - DB6: Authorization to execute operating system commands**

**Symptom**

You can execute operating system commands using the infrastructure of the DBA Cockpit. The usage of this infrastructure is not secured by SAP authorizations and is not only restricted to reading operating system commands.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.0
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

SAP provides this CVSS Base Score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this SAP Note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is therefore not intended to replace any risk assessments that you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see ["FAQs"](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/) at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

This problem occurs because an authorization check is missing.

**Solution**

This error is corrected by the relevant Support Package. For an advanced correction, you can implement the [correction instructions](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001903756/41).

The correction ensures that changing operating system commands can no longer be executed. Read commands can only be executed if the user has the authorization for the authorization object `S_ADMI_FCD`.
