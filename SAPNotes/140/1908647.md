1908647 - cross site flashing

**Symptom**

SBOP Explorer can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 5.0
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:P/I:N/A:N

**Other Terms**

Reflected cross-site flashing, XSS, SBOP Explorer

**Reason and Prerequisites**

One page within SBOP Explorer does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site flashing issue. A reflected cross-site flashing attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.

Reflected cross-site flashing can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

The solution is included in:

- 4.0 SP7 Patch1 and later
- 4.0 SP8
- 4.1 SP1 Patch1 and later
- 4.1 SP2
