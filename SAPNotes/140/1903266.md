**Correction Instructions**

After implementing the code correctly in your system, ensure that the report `BBP_CRE_TAB_OAPP_SEC` exists. If it does not, create it manually using transaction SE38 for a temporary package. The report is needed only once and can be deleted afterward. Then, copy and paste the displayed report coding into your report version.

To create the necessary table `BBP_WFL_OAPP_SEC`, call the report `BBP_CRE_TAB_OAPP_SEC`. Mark the radio button 'SHOWLOGS' and press the button 'Execute (F8)'.
