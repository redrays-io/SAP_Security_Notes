1796264 - Code injection vulnerability in LDAP- and VSCAN-Customizing

**Description**

### Symptom

LDAP- and VSCAN-Customizing contains code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice.

An attacker can therefore control the behavior of the system, or can potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code, without having their own legitimate credentials.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 7.1
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/AU:S/C:C/I:C/A:C

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Other Terms

Injection, run, credentials, VSCAN, LDAP.

### Reason and Prerequisites

The program code contains a possibility to define and execute user-defined code that changes the behavior of the system. A valid and authenticated user is required.

Depending on the code, the user can:

- Inject and run their own code.
- Obtain additional information that should not be displayed.
- Modify data, delete data.
- Modify the output of the system.
- Create new users with higher privileges.
- Perform a denial of service attack.

### Solution

Implement the program change of this note or the corresponding support package.
