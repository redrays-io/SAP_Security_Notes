1791490 - Potential denial of service in SAP Kernel (Diag parser)

**Symptom**

An attacker can remotely exploit the Diag Parser in the kernel, rendering it, and potentially the resources that are used to serve the Diag Parser, unavailable.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 7.1
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:N/A:C

**Description**

An attacker can trigger a condition in which the process creates a core dump, causing it to restart. This results in the entire machine becoming unresponsive until the process is available again. This flaw can be exploited to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, intentionally provoking the condition to cause service disruption.
