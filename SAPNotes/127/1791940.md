1791940 - Potential modification of persisted data in MDS

**SAP Security Note 1791940 - Potential modification of persisted data in MDS**

**Symptom**
An attacker can exploit MDS and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, resulting in the modification of data persisted by the system.

**Description**
The issue is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code constructs an SQL statement that includes strings which can be manipulated by an attacker. The altered SQL statement can then be used to modify information in the database.

**Solution**
Implement the attached [Correction Instruction](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001791940/485) to mitigate the vulnerability and prevent exploitation.
