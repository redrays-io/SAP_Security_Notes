### Description

#### Symptom
This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see [Security Note 2074889](https://me.sap.com/notes/0002074889).

An attacker can exploit the message server to enable them to take complete control of the product, including viewing, changing, or deleting data.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 10.0
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

#### Other Terms
Buffer overflow, RCE, remote code execution, message server

#### Reason and Prerequisites
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the message server. This enables an attacker to inject code into the working memory that is subsequently executed by the application. It can also be used to cause a general fault in the product, causing the product to terminate.

### Solution
This vulnerability is fixed with the kernel patch level assigned to this note or higher. Since the vulnerability affects only the message server, it is safe to exchange just the message server executable with the new one. For kernel releases 720 and 721, a fixed version of the SP stack kernel will be provided.
