1669048 - Unauthorized modification of BSP in CRM-ANA

**Title:** Unauthorized modification of BSP in CRM-ANA

**Description:**
CRM-ANA can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Symptom:**
A malicious user can modify application content and steal authentication information from other users, potentially leading to impersonation and full compromise of the application's security.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
Certain BSP pages within CRM-ANA do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This can be exploited to steal user authentication data and impersonate users, including administrators.
