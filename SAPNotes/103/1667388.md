1667388 - Explicit Scope Declaration issues in BRMS-CORE

**SAP Security Note 1667388 Overview**

**Description:**
In BRMS-CORE, there are issues with the explicit scope declaration of fields, methods, and classes. Classes, methods, and variables without explicit `public`, `private`, or `protected` labels are accessible within the same package, posing significant security risks. An attacker could introduce a new class into the package and access elements that were intended to be hidden.

**Affected Components:**
- **BRMS-CORE Versions:** 7.20, 7.30, 7.31

**Solution:**
Apply the appropriate patch matching your support package version as listed below. Follow the instructions in the NetWeaver Support Package Stack Guide to ensure correct installation.
