1670153 - Unauthorized modification in ITS-Services in SWP.

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.05.2012  
**Component:** Industry-Specific Components > Automotive > Supplier Workplace (IS-A-SWP)

### Description

**Symptom:**  
Supplier Workplace (IS-A-SWP) can be abused by a malicious user, allowing unauthorized modification of displayed application content and the potential theft of authentication information from legitimate users.

**Other Terms:**  
Cross-site scripting (XSS), Application Component (e.g., FIN-SEM-CPM)

**Reason and Prerequisites:**  
ITS Services within IS-A-SWP (including ME_SWP, ME_SWP_ALERT, ME_SWP_CO, ME_SWP_GUI, ME_SWP_IV, ME_SWP_PDI, ME_SWP_PH, ME_SWP_SRI) do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This can be exploited to steal authentication data, enabling the impersonation of users, including administrators, potentially compromising the security of the application.
