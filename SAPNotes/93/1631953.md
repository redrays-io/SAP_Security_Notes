1631953 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in MDC SSO

## Description

### Symptom
Multi Domain SSO cookie login can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, MDC, Multi Domain SSO cookie

### Reason and Prerequisites
The MDC component within the Portal application does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue.

A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution
You can disable MDC functionality by removing the hosts that you have entered in the UME property `ume.login.mdc.hosts`. Then the SSO will only work within the domain (and possibly sub-domains depending on your configuration) where you initially log in.
