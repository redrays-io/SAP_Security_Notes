SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://me.sap.com/securitynotes](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes).

### Reason and Prerequisites

The security vulnerabilities are found in the class `CL_BSP_LOGIN_HANDLER` used in BSP applications. This class is not protected against XSS and iframe-related security vulnerabilities. The obsolete class `CL_BSP_LOGIN_HANDLER` is no longer maintained and developed and will not be included in new SAP systems in the future.

### Solution

Please update SAP Basis to an SP or release where the issue is fixed. Refer to the **Support Package** section below for details and available patches.
