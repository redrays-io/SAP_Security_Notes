*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.*

### Reason and Prerequisites

The reading of information is only possible in the following situation:
1. Start transaction `SICF`, execute with "Hierarchy Type" = "Service".
2. In the hierarchy of "Virtual Hosts / Services" navigate to `/default_host/sap/public/bc/trex/test/`.
   - Here the service `inspection` is active.

If this service is **not** active, then no attack is possible.

### Solution

**Immediate solution**:
- Switch the service `inspection` to inactive; or better: directly delete this service!
- This service is a leftover from early tests. It is not needed in any business scenario or for any other function.
- De-activation or deletion of this service has no negative consequences whatsoever.

**Final solution**:
- This service is (or will be) removed with the following Support Packages:
  - Netweaver 7.00, SAP_BASIS 700, Support Package 33.
  - Netweaver 7.01, SAP_BASIS 701, Support Package 18.
  - Netweaver 7.02, SAP_BASIS 702, Support Package 18.
  - Netweaver 7.30, SAP_BASIS 730, Support Package 12.
  - Netweaver 7.31, SAP_BASIS 731, Support Package 16.
  - Netweaver 7.40, SAP_BASIS 740, Support Package 11.
