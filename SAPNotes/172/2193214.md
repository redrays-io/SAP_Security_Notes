2193214 - Potential false redirection of Web site content in SAP Internet Communication Framework

**Description**

SAP Internet Communication Framework (ICF) is susceptible to phishing attacks that exploit URL redirection. An attacker can publish a URL that appears to originate from SAP ICF, which then redirects users to a malicious site of the attackerâ€™s choice. This can deceive users into trusting the fake site and inadvertently disclose sensitive information, such as authentication credentials.

**Symptoms**

- Malicious URLs redirecting users from legitimate SAP ICF pages to attacker-controlled websites.
- Users may be tricked into entering sensitive information on fraudulent pages that mimic SAP ICF interfaces.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should implement the support package mentioned in this SAP Note or apply the provided correction instructions.
