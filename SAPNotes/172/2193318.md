**Reason and Prerequisites**

Android applications built with the Cordova framework that don't have explicit values set in `Config.xml` can have undefined configuration variables set by Intent. This can cause unwanted dialogs to appear in applications and changes in the application's behavior that can include the app force-closing.

**Solution**

Cordova versions 4.0.0 and 4.0.1 should be upgraded to 4.0.2 to overcome this vulnerability.

If Cordova 3.x version is used, ensure it is upgraded to Cordova 3.7.2.

When using the Cordova CLI, use the following commands:

```bash
cordova platform add android@4.0.2
```

or

```bash
cordova platform add android@3.7.2
```
