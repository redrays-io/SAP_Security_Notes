### Reason and Prerequisites

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in some revisions of the SAP HANA Extended Application Services. If an attacker has network access to the HTTP interface of SAP HANA Extended Application Services, the vulnerability might enable an attacker to inject code into the working memory that is subsequently executed by the application. It can also be used to cause a general fault in the product, causing the product to terminate.

### Solution

The issue is fixed with revision 92 (for SPS09) and 85.05 (for SPS08). SPS10 is not affected. Update to these or later revisions.

**Workaround:** Restrict access to SAP HANA Extended Application Services (XS) by limiting network access to the SAP HANA Extended Application Services network ports of the HANA server.
