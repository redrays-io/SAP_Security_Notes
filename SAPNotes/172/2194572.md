2194572 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in StringBufferPoolMonitor

**Symptom**

*This note has been updated with new support packages and patches information.*

StringBufferPoolMonitor can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3 / 10

  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
  - **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium (M)

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://support.sap.com/securitynotes).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

StringBufferPoolMonitor Portal Component does not sufficiently encode the `sizeinput` parameter, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Additionally, it can steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session, allowing an attacker to impersonate the user and access information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**
