SAP Security Note 2193416 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in WebDynpro Java

---

**Description**

### Symptom

WebDynpro Java can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 4.3 / 10
- **CVSS Base Vector:**

| Key                             | Value         |

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://me.sap.com/support/spring/evaluation](https://support.sap.com/securitynotes).

### Reason and Prerequisites

Pages within WebDynpro Java do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution

Please apply the note to get the issue fixed.
