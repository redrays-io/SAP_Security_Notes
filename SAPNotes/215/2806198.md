**SAP Security Note 2806198 - [CVE-2020-6203] Path Manipulation in SAP NetWeaver UDDI Server (Services Registry)**

### Description

**Symptom**

*Services Registry* allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of path information provided by users. Characters representing 'traverse to parent directory' are passed through to the file APIs.

Some well-known impacts of Directory Traversal vulnerability are:
- Attacker could read content of arbitrary files on the remote server and expose sensitive data
- Attacker could overwrite, delete, or corrupt arbitrary files on the remote server

**Other Terms**

Path traversal, backtracking, directory climbing, [CVE-2020-6203](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6203)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

*Services Registry* fails to correctly validate the path specified in the importing UDDI content and can reference a file that exists on the remote server. As a result, an attacker can potentially direct the program to an arbitrary other file in the system, overwriting its content.

**Solution**

Implement the Support Packages and Patches referenced by this SAP Note.
