3078072 - [CVE-2021-33704] Missing Authorization Check in SAP Business One (Service Layer)

---

**Symptom**

The Service Layer of SAP Business One allows an authenticated attacker to invoke certain functions that would otherwise be restricted to specific users. For an attacker to discover the vulnerable function, no extensive system knowledge is required. Once exploited via the network stack, the attacker may be able to read, modify, or delete restricted data. The impact is that missing authorization can result in the abuse of functionality usually restricted to specific users.

**Solution**

The affected functions have now been enforced to properly check access restrictions. Customers need to implement or upgrade to **SAP Business One 10.0 FP2105 Hotfix1**.
