3073450 - [CVE-2021-33691] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Development Infrastructure (Notification Service)

**Symptom**
SAP NetWeaver Development Infrastructure Notification Service does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows a threat actor to send crafted scripts to a victim. If the victim has an active session when the crafted script is executed, the threat actor could compromise information in the victimâ€™s session and gain access to sensitive information.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The vulnerability occurs due to improper encoding of user input.

**Solution**
- User input is now properly encoded to prevent a successful XSS attack.
- Implement the Support Packages and Patches referenced by this SAP Note.
