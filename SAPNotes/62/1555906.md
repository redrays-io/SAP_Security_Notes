1555906 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in HTMLB

**Description**

### Symptom
HTMLB can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, HTMLB

### Reason and Prerequisites
HTMLB does not sufficiently encode input or output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. It can also be used to steal another userâ€™s authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**
The issue described above will be fixed by an HTMLB for Java patch. In the "SP Patch Level" section, you can find information on which patches contain the respective correction.

**Downloading HTMLB for Java Patches:**
