### Description

#### Symptom
Correction instructions for the directory traversal vulnerability described in Security Note 1512352 must be corrected for all releases. The corrected correction instructions have been added to this note.

Even though you have maintained Customizing for the logical file names for the input file and output file of the report RCCLBI03, the physical file names that are assigned are not identified as valid.

#### Other Terms
Directory traversal, update, Update Note

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Security Note 1512352 contains correction instructions that are incorrect and require a correction.

#### Solution
Implement the correction instructions.

If you have not yet implemented Note 1512352, it is implemented automatically as a required note.

If you want to store the output file on the application server, use the logical file name `CLASSIFICATION_ERROR`. The name defines the path under which the output file is saved. The system suggests `RCCLBI03.ERROR` as the file name, but you can choose your own file name. The path is not specified either on the presentation server. Here, `CLASSIFICATION_ERROR` (if defined) represents a default value.

`CLASSIFICATION_ERROR` must also be defined in Customizing.
