**Release Date:** December 14, 2010  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** Basis Components > Business Management > Business Workflow > Web Integration  
**Language:** English

### Symptom
An attacker can trigger functionality in the Business Workflow area without the relevant authentication and authorization.

### Other Terms
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- XSRF
- BWWI_EXECUTE
- BWWF_WI_DECI

### Reason and Prerequisites
Specified Internet services execute certain functions through referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the functions are executed in the Business Workflow area with the rights of the user. The attacker may use a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack or present a clickable link to the victim.

### Solution
1. **Read [Note 1481392](https://me.sap.com/notes/1481392) for additional information and further instructions.** The corrections from Note 1481392 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.
2. Implement the correction instructions contained in this note. The program `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_BC_BMT_WFM` (among other things) is created in your system.
3. Execute the program `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_BC_BMT_WFM` and select the transport request when prompted. The program adds the service parameters for the adjusted ITS services.
