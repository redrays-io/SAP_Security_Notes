1518688 - Hard-coded credentials in BO Test Shell

**SAP Security Note 1518688 Overview**

**Symptom**
BO Test Shell contains code that alters the program's behavior when a user is successfully authenticated with a specific username.

**Description**
The program code includes a hard-coded username intended for testing and debugging purposes. This username modifies the system's behavior upon successful authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized users to access additional information that should remain restricted.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The presence of a hard-coded username poses a security risk by enabling unintended access within the BO Test Shell. This vulnerability allows users to obtain confidential information beyond their authorized access level.

**Solution**
The hard-coded username has been removed to eliminate the security vulnerability. The fix is available in NW 7.2L (ByD FP2.5). To apply the fix, please follow the steps below:
