## Overview

**SAP Note/KBA Number:** 1526168  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 13.09.2011  
**Component:** Basis Components > Middleware > Internet Communication Framework (BC-MID-ICF)

## Description

**Symptom:**  
Data in the Internet Communication Framework (ICF) can be abused by a malicious user, allowing unauthorized modification of displayed application content and potential theft of authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Details:**  
API interfaces within the ICF do not sufficiently encode input/output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This can be exploited to deface or modify displayed content and steal users' authentication data, leading to impersonation and unauthorized access. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

## Solution

Implement the specified source code corrections by following the provided correction instructions.
