1526048 - SAP GUI Security: Enhancements for patch 4

**SAP Note Details**

- **Number:** 1526048
- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Version:** 4
- **Recency:** New
- **Language:** English
- **Category:** Advance development
- **Priority:** Correction with high priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer
- **Released On:** 14.12.2010
- **Component:** BC-FES-GUI

**Description**

The security functionality available in patches 0 through 3 did not cover the checking of connections to systems via command lines, SAP shortcuts, and Structured Documents. Without the checks implemented in patch 4, an attacker could theoretically abuse an SAP shortcut to execute a function in an SAP system without the user being initially aware of this.

**Solution**

Patch level 4 adds the following functionality:

1. **Checking of SAP Shortcut Connections:** 
   - It is now possible to start a transaction and provide values for the fields on the first screen of the transaction.
   - If specified, the first screen of the transaction can be skipped without any user interaction.
   - Users will be informed when a SAP shortcut attempts to connect to a system.

2. **Checking of Command Line Connections:** 
   - Users are now informed about connection attempts made via command lines.

3. **Checking of Connections via Structured Documents:** 
   - These connections are now checked against the security module, and users are informed about such attempts as required.

As a consequence of these enhancements, some actions that previously did not trigger a security popup will now lead to such a popup. To minimize the number of popups, administrators are advised to add rules specific to their environment in the SAP GUI for Windows security settings.

This note provides a permanent solution to the temporary measures provided in security note 1397000. After installing patch 4, the solutions in note 1397000 become unnecessary for securing SAP shortcuts.
