**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 6  
**Recency:** Updated  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 04.05.2011  
**Component:** Customer Relationship Management > Middleware (CRM-MW)

### **Symptom**
An authenticated user can exploit functionalities of CRM Middleware that should have restricted access, potentially leading to an escalation of privileges. Additionally, a malicious user might uncover information related to internal tables or fields of CRM Middleware, aiding in more targeted attacks against the system.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
CRM Middleware lacks sufficient permission checks for certain authenticated user actions, which may result in unintended system behavior. Information exposure through CRM Middleware can be leveraged by malicious actors to refine their attack strategies.

### **Solution**
