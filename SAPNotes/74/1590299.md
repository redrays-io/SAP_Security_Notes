SAP Security Note 1590299 - Directory Traversal in PP-BD-RTG

**Description**

**Symptom**
Potential directory traversal in the following components: PP-BD-RTG

**Other Terms**
Directory traversal, PP-BD-RTG

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The programs specified in the correction instructions contain vulnerabilities through which a malicious user can potentially read arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly disclosing confidential information.

Some of the programs specified in the correction instructions contain a vulnerability through which a malicious user can potentially write arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

**Solution**
For additional information and instructions, see [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003). The corrections provided in Note 1497003 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.

**Logical File Name Used in this Solution**
The following logical file names have been created to enable the validation of the following logical file names:
- CP_RTG_DATA_LOAD

**Recommendations for Setting Up Logical File Names**
To avoid maintaining a high number of logical file names, some of the programs share the same logical file name.

Using the same logical file name for various programs creates dependencies among these programs. To securely separate data created by different users and different programs, try to create a directory structure that reflects the user name and/or program name, and use this information when setting up the physical path and file names for the logical file paths and file names.
