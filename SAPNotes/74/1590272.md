**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 12.07.2011

### Description

**Symptom**

Hrrcf_searchhlp can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**

Stored cross-site scripting, XSS, Hrrcf_searchhlp.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The BSP Page Hrrcf_searchhlp results in a stored cross-site scripting issue. It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the malicious user to embed content that is rendered automatically without targeting victims individually. Stored cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Implement the attached correction instructions to resolve the issue.
