1590555 - Unauthorized use of application functions in WEBCUIF

**Symptom**
An attacker can execute functions in WEBCUIF without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
Cross-site request forgery (XSRF), WEBCUIF

**Reason and Prerequisites**
WEBCUIF executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. An attacker can trick an authenticated user's browser into making a request with a specific URL and parameters, causing the function to execute with the user's privileges. This can be achieved through cross-site scripting attacks or by presenting a malicious link to the victim.

**Solution**
1. **Refer to [Note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324)** for additional information and instructions. The corrections from this note are a prerequisite for implementing Note 1590555.

2. **Implement the correction instructions of Note 1590555:**
   - Depending on your SAP release, implementing this note will create specific reports in your system to activate XSRF protection for the adapted BSP applications.
   - Execute these reports and specify a corresponding transport request number when prompted. This will enable the XSRF protection mechanisms necessary to secure WEBCUIF functions.
