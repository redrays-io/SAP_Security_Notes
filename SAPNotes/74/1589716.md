1589716 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in the Portal

**SAP Security Note 1589716 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in the Portal**

**Description**
  
The Portal can be abused by a malicious user allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Symptom**

A reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists within the Portal runtime. This allows attackers to:
- Non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on the website.
- Steal another user's authentication information, potentially leading to impersonation and unauthorized access.
- If an administrator is impersonated, it may result in a full compromise of the application's security.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 4.3
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

*Note:* The CVSS score provided is an estimate and does not account for specific system configurations or operational environments. It is recommended to conduct a thorough risk assessment to determine the applicability and priority of this security note for your systems. More information can be found in the [FAQ section](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/faq).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The issue arises because the Portal runtime does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected XSS vulnerability. This allows attackers to:
- Modify displayed content without authorization.
- Steal authentication data from legitimate users.
- Potentially impersonate users with the same access rights, including administrators, leading to significant security breaches.

**Solution**

To address this security issue, apply the appropriate Support Package (SP) Patch Level. You can find the relevant patches under the "SP Patch Level" tab in this security note.
