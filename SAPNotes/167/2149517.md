SAP Security Note 2149517 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in NetWeaver Administrator

**Title:** Unauthorized modification of displayed content in NetWeaver Administrator

**Symptom**
SAP NetWeaver Administrator (NWA) can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 3.5 / 10
- **Attack Vector:** Network (N)
- **Attack Complexity:** Medium (M)
- **Authentication:** Single (S)
- **Confidentiality Impact:** None (N)
- **Integrity Impact:** Partial (P)
- **Availability Impact:** None (N)

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://me.sap.com/support/sfm/notes).*

**Reason and Prerequisites**
An input field in NWA does not sufficiently encode user input, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. This vulnerability can be exploited to permanently modify displayed content from a web site, allowing attackers to embed content that is rendered automatically without targeting victims individually. Additionally, stored XSS can be used to steal another user's authentication information, potentially allowing attackers to impersonate users and access information with their privileges. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**
Update your AS Java to a Support Package (SP) or release where the issue is fixed. Refer to the SP Patch Level section in the note for details and available patches.
