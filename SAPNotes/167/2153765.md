#### Other Terms
SQL injection, database, SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench, HANA WebIDE

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by an attacker. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to retrieve additional data from the database or to modify the data.

The vulnerability can only be exploited by users with a valid user account and privileges to execute the SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench (privileges sap.hana.xs.ide.roles::*). The impact of a potential misuse of the vulnerability is limited to the granted SQL privileges of the user.

### Solution
The issue has been fixed with HANA revision 94 (for SPS09) and revision 85.3 (for SPS08). Update at least to these revisions.
