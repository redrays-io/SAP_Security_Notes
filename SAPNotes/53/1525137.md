**SAP Security Note 1525137: Unauthorized usage of application functionality in BCV**

**Description**
A malicious user can trigger functionality in Business Context Viewer (BCV) without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF)
- CA-EPT-BCV

**Reason and Prerequisites**
BCV executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. An attacker can trick an authenticated user's browser into making a request with a specific URL and parameters, causing the function to be executed with the user's rights. This can be achieved through a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack or by presenting a clickable link to the victim.

1. Refer to [Note 1481392](https://me.sap.com/notes/1481392) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from Note 1481392 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.
