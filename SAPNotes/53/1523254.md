SAP Security Note 1523254 - Update #1 to Security Note 1481924

**Header Data**
- **SAP Note/KBA**: 1523254
- **Type**: SAP Security Note
- **Version**: 5
- **Recency**: Updated
- **Language**: English
- **Category**: Program error
- **Priority**: Correction with high priority
- **Release Status**: Released for Customer
- **Released On**: 19.01.2011
- **Component**: Basis Components > Middleware > RFC

**Symptom**
A malicious user can exploit a memory corruption in the RFC library and take complete control of the product, including viewing, changing, or deleting data.

As an update to the original version of this note, the affected SAP GUI versions have been included and the patch levels that contain a correction have been described more precisely.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
You use RFC SDK Version 6.40, 7.10, 7.11, or 7.20. In these versions, buffer overflows may occur in the address space of the process due to an insufficient check of interface parameters. Actual attack scenarios are known only for the SAPLogon ActiveX control shipped with SAP GUI for Windows. The vulnerable versions of the RFC library are also contained in SAP GUI for Windows 7.10 and 7.20 versions. Therefore, an update to a current patch level of these components is necessary.

**Solution**
Install a new version of the RFC lib on your computer. Versions 7.00 and 7.01 are not susceptible to this problem. For more information, see [Note 1445409](https://me.sap.com/notes/1445409).

If you are using the SAP GUI for Windows, the fix is included in the following (or higher) patch levels:

- **7.10** patchlevel 19
- **7.20** patchlevel 2

If you are using the RFC SDK, a fix is contained in the following patch levels:

- **SAP librfc 6.40** (Patch-level #79)
- **SAP librfc 7.10** (Patch-level #32)
- **SAP librfc 7.11** (Patch-level #21)
- **SAP librfc 7.20** (Patch-level #9)
