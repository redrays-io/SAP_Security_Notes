SAP Security Note 1524940 - Update #1 for security note 1281820

### SAP Security Note 1524940 - Update #1 for Security Note 1281820

**Released On:** December 6, 2010  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Recency:** Updated  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** HotNews  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** Basis Components > Database Interface, Database Platforms > MaxDB

#### Symptom
A weakness in the check of the input parameter in WebDBM permits the infiltration of JavaScript code into your browser. As a result, an attacker can access the session cookie of an existing database administration session and potentially hijack the session.

**WebDBM is no longer supported for database administration.** SAP no longer provides updates for WebDBM.

**Recommendation:**  
Uninstall WebDBM and migrate to Database Studio for database administration.

- **Uninstall WebDBM** as described in this note.
- **Install Database Studio** using [Note 1097311](https://me.sap.com/notes/1097311).

This update adds instructions to the original [Note 1281820](https://me.sap.com/notes/1281820) explaining how to apply a workaround to secure the system until WebDBM is replaced by Database Studio.

#### Solution
If you are using WebDBM, follow the instructions in [Note 1281820](https://me.sap.com/notes/1281820) to:

1. **Uninstall WebDBM.**
2. **Replace WebDBM with MaxDB Database Studio.**

**Temporary Measures Until Migration:**

- **Restrict Network Access:** Limit access to the host running the WebDBM service so that only database administrators can access it.
  - **Install a firewall** on the host with the WebDBM service.
  - **Configure the firewall** to allow access only from specified client hosts of database administrators.
- **Alternative Solution:** Group the client hosts of the database administrators with the host of the WebDBM service in a separate subnetwork that does not permit external access to the WebDBM service port.
