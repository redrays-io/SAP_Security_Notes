**Details**

- **Type:** SAP Security Note

**Symptom**
A malicious user can trigger functionality in the Internet Kanban without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF)

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The Internet Kanban executes specific functions by referencing URLs. An attacker can trick an authenticated userâ€™s browser into making a request with certain URLs and parameters, causing the function to execute with the user's permissions. This can be achieved via a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack or by presenting a clickable link to the victim.

2. Implement the correction instructions relevant to your release. This action will create the report `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_PK_500_605` in your system.
3. Execute the `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_PK_500_605` report and provide a transport order number when prompted. This report adds service parameters for the adjusted ITS services.
