1525156 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in WebDynpro.

**Symptom**
WebDynpro application could be abused by a malicious user, who could modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting, XSS, WD-RUNTIME, FRAMEWORK, WebDynpro for Java.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The WebDynpro Framework does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This can be exploited to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Attackers can steal users' authentication information, potentially allowing them to impersonate users and access information with the same privileges. If an administrator is impersonated, the application's security could be fully compromised.

**Solution**
The issue will be fixed by a WebDynpro for Java patch.
