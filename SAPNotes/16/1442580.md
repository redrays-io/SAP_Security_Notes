1442580 - Potential disclosure of authentication information

### Symptom
The application 'Alert-Configuration' within XI/PI Runtime Workbench (RWB) can be exploited by a malicious user to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
- Security Update
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Reason and Prerequisites
Certain pages within the RWB Alert-Configuration do not adequately encode input parameters, leading to reflected cross-site scripting issues and cross-domain redirection vulnerabilities.

Reflected XSS can be utilized to steal another user's authentication information, such as session data, or to non-permanently deface a website. An attacker with access to this data could impersonate the user and access all information with the same privileges as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, it may result in a full compromise of the application's security.
