1440336 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content- JPR

---

### Symptom
Java Proxy Runtime (JPR) Transport servlet has a vulnerability to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

An attacker may specify unknown values of parameters with malicious script commands, causing these scripts to execute in the user's browser.

### Other Terms
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Java Proxy Runtime (JPR)
- JPR

### Reason and Prerequisites
The Java Proxy Runtime (JPR) Transport servlet does not sufficiently encode input parameters, making it vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting attacks.

An attacker can present a victim with a malicious link. When the victim clicks the link, malicious script commands execute in the user's browser. This can compromise the user's security context, including browser cookies and cache objects. It can also cause the victim's browser to automatically navigate to URLs on the vulnerable site, allowing the attacker to intrude into the security context of the victim.

Reflected XSS can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as session data. An attacker with access to this data could impersonate the user and access all information with the same permissions. If an administrator is impersonated, the application's security could be fully compromised.

### Solution
Apply the patch as per the Service Pack (SP) level. You can download the patch from the [Download for SNOTE](https://notesdownloads.sap.com/note/0040000016979802017) link or access the PDF version [here](https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/sfm/notes/print/0001440336?language=en-US&token=74719F5997C3ECF88B0E4C9D115722BE).
