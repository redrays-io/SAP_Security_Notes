1950292 - Potential false redirection of Web site content in SRM-EBP-CAT

## Description

**Symptom**

SRM-EBP-CAT can be exploited for phishing attacks by allowing an attacker to publish a URL that appears to be from the product, which redirects the victim to a malicious URL of the attacker's choice. This enables the attacker to falsely gain the trust of the victim and obtain private data, such as authentication information.

### CVSS Information

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:P/I:N/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

### Other Terms

- Cross-domain redirection
- SRM-EBP-CAT

### Reason and Prerequisites

Certain pages within SRM-EBP-CAT allow cross-domain redirection. An attacker can embed a URL from a different domain into a URL of the target application and send it to a user. The user believes the content is from the legitimate application, but upon visiting the page, the content is served from the attacker's chosen domain.

The attacker can then replicate pages of the legitimate application (e.g., a login page) to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords. Mitigation involves restricting redirections to relative or local domains only.
