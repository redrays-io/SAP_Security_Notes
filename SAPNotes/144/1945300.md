1945300 - Missing whitelist check in QM-IM

**SAP Security Note 1945300 - Missing whitelist check in QM-IM**

**Released On:** February 11, 2014  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Component:** Quality Management > Quality Inspection > Results Recording (QM-IM-RR)  
**CVSS Base Score:** 6.0 (AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)

### **Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functions of QM-IM to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
QM-IM does not contain required checks against a positive set of allowed functions (i.e., a whitelist) during the execution of these functions. This is necessary to verify that authenticated users are permitted to access these functions. The missing check may result in undesired system behavior.

### **Solution**
Implement the available support package or apply the correction instructions provided in this note.

**Maintenance Steps:**
1. Navigate to **Quality Management** in your SAP system.
2. Go to **Quality Inspection > Subsystems > Process quality inspections using QM-IDI-interface**.
3. Define the Subsystem Connection for QM-IDI Interface.
4. Double-click on the subsystem (QDR system) and maintain the allowed function modules in the field `V_QISUB-NOTIFYFUNCTION`.
