SAP Security Note 1942511 - Missing authorization check in Incident Management

**Description**
  
Incident search dialog does not contain proper authorization checks for validating an authenticated user's authorization to access some of the incident information. This may result in undesired revealing of confidential information. An authenticated user who does not have the access level of "Confidential Access" or "Person Involved Access" may still execute specific searches to find a participant in an incident.
