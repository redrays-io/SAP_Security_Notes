1942592 - ICM Check of Certificates Forwarded by Intermediary

**SAP Security Note 1942592** addresses an issue in the Internet Communication Manager (ICM) related to the handling of forwarded client certificates. 

### Symptom
ICM accepts forwarded requests from intermediaries when either the **subject** or **issuer** of the client certificate matches.

### Reason and Prerequisites
This issue occurs when certificate forwarding is configured in the ICM of your application server using the parameters `icm/HTTPS/trust_client_with_subject` and `icm/HTTPS/trust_client_with_issuer`.

### Impact
Without this fix, ICM accepts certificates if **either** the subject **or** the issuer matches, which may not meet the desired security criteria.

### Solution
Apply at least the patch level specified in the "SP Patch Level" section of the note to ensure that ICM only accepts certificates where **both** the subject and the issuer match.
