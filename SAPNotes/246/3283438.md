3283438 - [CVE-2023-25617] OS Command Execution vulnerability in SAP Business Objects Business Intelligence Platform (Adaptive Job Server)

**Symptom**

Due to incorrectly escaped parameters in Unix, SAP Business Objects Business Intelligence Platform (Adaptive Job Server) allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands over the network. On successful exploitation, the attacker can completely compromise the application, causing high impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.

**Other Terms**

AJS, [CVE-2023-25617](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25617)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Some parameters are not correctly escaped. This issue is Unix-specific. All platforms are vulnerable to the issue described in [Security Note 3245526](https://me.sap.com/notes/3245526).

**Solution**

This issue is fixed in the patches listed in the **Support Package Patches** section below.

For Business Intelligence Platform maintenance schedule and strategy, see the Knowledge Base Article [2144559](https://me.sap.com/notes/2144559) in the References section.

Some programs may stop working if they rely on an unsafe mechanism.

**Workaround**

Please assess the workaround applicability for your SAP landscape prior to implementation.

Note that this workaround is a temporary fix and is not a permanent solution. SAP strongly recommends applying the corrections outlined in the security note, which can be done instead of the workaround or after implementing the workaround.

If you cannot apply the patch, then as an interim fix, disable program execution:

1. In the Central Management Console, navigate to **Application > Central Management Console > Program Object Rights**, and uncheck **"Run scripts/binaries"** and **"Run Java programs"**.
2. Or, disable the service `rexecd`, if it is enabled.
