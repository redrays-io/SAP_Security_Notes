3283283 - [CVE-2023-0013] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS for ABAP and ABAP Platform

**Symptom**

**Update 24th January 2023:** This note has been re-released with updated 'Support Packages & Patches' information. Validity for the release 7.40 SP09 has been added.

The ABAP Keyword Documentation of SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. On successful exploitation, an attacker can cause limited impact on the confidentiality and integrity of the application.

**Other Terms**
- XSS
- Reflected XSS
- CSS
- [CVE-2023-0013](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0013)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The URL for the web version of the ABAP keyword documentation is not sufficiently protected against illegal path extensions. Such path extensions are possible since the Internet Communication Framework allows longer URLs than necessary for the ABAP Keyword Documentation.

**Solution**

1. **Deactivate Unnecessary ICF Nodes**
   - Do not activate the ICF nodes `/sap/public/bc/abap/docu` and `/sap/bc/abap/docu` if they are not necessary. These nodes are only required before release 7.55 in development systems where ADT is used.

2. **Implement Support Packages**
   - In systems where the ICF nodes `/sap/public/bc/abap/docu` and `/sap/bc/abap/docu` are active, implement the [support packages](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB70226) mentioned in this SAP Note or the respective correction instructions.

3. **Apply Corrections**
   - The correction invalidates path specifications to prevent exploitation.

**CVSS**

- **Score:** 6.1
- **Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
