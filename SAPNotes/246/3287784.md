3287784 - [CVE-2023-24527] Improper Access Control in SAP NetWeaver AS Java for Deploy Service

**Description**

Deploy Service in SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java does not perform any access control checks for functionalities that require user identity, enabling an unauthenticated attacker to attach to an open interface and use an open naming and directory API to access a service. This allows them to access server settings and data without modifying them, having no effect on availability and integrity.

**Change Log**

**v10 (Current version)** - **UPDATE 11th February 2025**: This note has been re-released with updated ‘Solution’ information.

**v9 (Initial Version)**

**Solution**

Update NW Application Server Java to a release or Support Package where the problem is fixed. Refer to the "Validity" and "Support Packages & Patches" sections of this SAP Note for details and available patches. To avoid incompatibilities on the system, please check SAP Note [1974464](https://me.sap.com/notes/1974464) - Information on SCA Dependency Analysis for Java download objects.

If you are using SAP MII along with SAP NetWeaver, ensure that MII components are at a version higher than those mentioned in Note [3316021](https://me.sap.com/notes/3316021). If not, please obtain the latest patch for those components from the service marketplace.
