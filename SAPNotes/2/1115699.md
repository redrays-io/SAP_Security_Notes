SAP Security Note 1115699 - CO-OM Tools: SE16N: Adapting to SE16

---

**SAP Note Number**: 1115699  
**Title**: CO-OM Tools: SE16N: Adapting to SE16  
**Type**: SAP Security Note  
**Version**: 5  
**Category**: Program Error  
**Priority**: Correction with Medium Priority  
**Status**: Released for Customer  
**Released On**: 07.05.2010  
**Component**: CO-OM (Controlling > Overhead Cost Controlling)

### Description

#### Symptom
- Executing a function module directly via SE37 bypasses the standard authorization checks that are enforced when the module is accessed through the intended transaction.
- The SE16N transaction menu contains unnecessary branches for the current environment.
- An additional transaction 'N' redirects to SE16N, creating potential security concerns.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Function modules are designed to perform specific processing tasks within a transaction, with authorization checks typically handled by the calling transaction. However, released modules callable by customer programs may bypass these checks, leading to unauthorized access or operations.

#### Solution
1. **Implement Program Changes**:
   - Modify SE16N modules to enforce identical authorization checks as those in the SE16N transaction.
   - Apply the program changes provided in the Support Packages linked to this note.
   - **Note**: Manual tasks are required for ERP Release 603 and are not included in the Support Packages.

2. **Remove Transaction Code 'N'**:
   - Use transaction SE93 to delete the transaction code 'N'.

3. **Clean Up SE16N Menu**:
   - Navigate to transaction SE80 for the function group 'SE16N'.
   - Expand 'GUI Status' and edit status '0100'.
   - Remove unnecessary menu entries by deleting specific menu codes.
   - Activate the updated status to apply changes.
