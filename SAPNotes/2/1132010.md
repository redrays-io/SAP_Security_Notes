## Title

**1132010 - Security note: Remote DB administration**

## Description

### Symptom

This security note has been updated; for more details, see [security note 1525003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1525003).

Due to a vulnerability in the MaxDB/liveCache DBM server, remote database administration can be exploited to execute any operating system command on the database server. See [Security Focus Archive](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/486039).

### Other Terms

x_server, dbmsrv, shell, security breach

### Reason and Prerequisites

- **Usage Requirements:**
  - You use MaxDB or liveCache.
  - Remote access to the database server is enabled for database administration or connectivity for database applications.

- **Platform Specifics:**
  - **LINUX/UNIX:** `x_server` is allowed and listens to incoming requests on the default port `sql6` `7210/tcp`.
  - **Windows:** The `x_server` service is started and listens to incoming requests on the default port `sql6` `7210/tcp`.

## Solution

The MaxDB development team is working on a solution affecting MaxDB Version 7.3 and higher. The solution will be available as soon as possible for the following versions:

- **SAP Software Distribution Center Downloads:**
  - **7.3.00.62** – APR/23/2008 (Win32 only)
  - **7.5.00.48** – 28.01.2008
  - **7.6.03.15** – 25.01.2008
  - **7.6.04.08** – 19.03.2008
  - **7.6.05.03** – No customer rollout
  - **7.7.02.20** – 05.02.2008
  - **7.7.03.23** – MAY/26/2008 (SAP SCM 2007 → LC/LCAPPS 5.1)
  - **7.7.04.09** – No customer rollout

**Next Steps:**
1. **Upgrade:** Perform an upgrade relevant to your release once it becomes available. Follow the instructions in [Note 498036](https://me.sap.com/notes/498036).
2. **Security Patch:** For liveCache customers unable to upgrade to the highest build of your version, a security patch for the DBM server is available in the current build. Use [Note 1133005](https://me.sap.com/notes/1133005) to verify if a security patch is available for your version.
3. **Password Requirements:** The assignment of usernames and passwords has changed to close this security gap. Refer to [Note 1147474](https://me.sap.com/notes/1147474) for details.
4. **Firewall Settings:** To prevent unauthorized remote access to MaxDB or liveCache DB servers, review and secure your firewall settings before the patch is applied.
