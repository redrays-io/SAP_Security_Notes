SAP Security Note 943336 - HttpOnly cookie attribute

**Overview**

This SAP Security Note outlines steps to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by configuring the J2EE Engine's Web Container to use the **HttpOnly** cookie attribute, supported in Microsoft Internet Explorer. Implementing this attribute helps protect essential system cookies (`JSESSIONID` and `saplb_`) from being accessed or manipulated through client-side scripts.

**Affected Components**

- **SAP-JEE**: Applicable to versions 6.40 SP17 (NW04s SP08) and higher, as well as all releases of SAP NW 7.10/CE.

**Solution**

To enable the **HttpOnly** attribute for system cookies, follow these steps:

1. **Enable HttpOnly Attribute**
   - Set the `SystemCookiesDataProtection` property of the HTTP Provider Service to `true`. This action will append the **HttpOnly** attribute to the relevant system cookies, enhancing their security.

2. **Maintaining Default Behavior**
   - If your application relies on accessing these cookies via client-side scripts, you may choose to keep the `SystemCookiesDataProtection` property set to `false`. This will retain the default behavior of the J2EE Engine from SP17 or earlier releases.
