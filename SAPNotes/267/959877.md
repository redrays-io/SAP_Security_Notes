### Description

There is a security breach on the standalone enqueue server: Files can be transferred across the network.

**Symptom:**  
Files can be transferred across the network using the standalone enqueue server. Although this server is usually protected by a firewall, there is a risk that confidential data could be accessed. The file transfer feature therefore poses a threat to security.

### Solution

This feature is deactivated in the enqueue server using the following patch levels:

- **6.40:** Patch Level 136
- **7.00:** Patch Level 66
