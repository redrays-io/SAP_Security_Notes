SAP Security Note 965201 - IGS HTTP administration commands

**Description**

This SAP Security Note provides information about deprecated HTTP administration commands in the Internet Graphics Service (IGS) and recommends actions to enhance security.

**Symptom**
You need information about the commands used in the IGS HTTP administration.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
You are using HTTP for the IGS administration.

**Solution**
With IGS 6.40 Patch 16 or higher and IGS 7.00 Patch 4 or higher, some deprecated HTTP administration commands have been removed. SAP recommends the following actions to secure your IGS:

1. **Disable the HTTP Listener**: If the HTTP listener is not required, disable it to prevent access to the IGS.
2. **Disable Administration Functionality**: If disabling the HTTP listener is not feasible, at least disable the administration functionality when it is not needed. This requires installing the latest IGS patch, after which the configuration is handled automatically as described in [SAP Note 959358](https://me.sap.com/notes/959358).

**Deprecated Commands**
All administration commands start with `ADM:` and can be accessed via URLs in the format `http://<IGS host>:<IGS port>/<command>[<parameter>]`. To block these commands, you can use firewall rules. The following commands have been disabled by default in the specified patches:

- `ADM:STATUS`: Shows the status of multiplexers, portwatchers, interpreters, and listeners.
- `ADM:STATISTICNEW`: Displays IGS-related statistics.
- `ADM:GETSTATCHART`: Provides a chart of IGS call statistics.
- `ADM:GETLOGFILE`: Displays log files from the multiplexer or portwatchers.
- `ADM:GETCONFIGFILE` (for IGS 6.40 only): Shows the IGS configuration file (`igs.xml`).
- `ADM:GETDUMP`: Lists or downloads dump files created by the IGS.
- `ADM:DELETEDUMP`: Deletes dump files created by the IGS.
- `ADM:SWITCH`: Manages dump file creation and trace levels.
- `ADM:SIM`: Processes IGS requests specified within a dump file.
