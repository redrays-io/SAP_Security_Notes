2175928 - Potential Remote Termination of Running Processes in SAP HANA Text Engine

**SAP Security Note 2175928** addresses a critical vulnerability in the SAP HANA Text Engine that allows an attacker to remotely terminate running processes. Below are the key details:

### **Symptom**
An attacker can remotely exploit the text engine in SAP HANA to manually terminate the index server. This can render the application unusable until it is restarted manually.

**CVSS Information**
