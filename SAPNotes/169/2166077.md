**SAP Security Note 2166077 - Missing authorization check in ABAP Workbench**

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functions of ABAP Workbench to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.0 / 10
- **CVSS Vector:**
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
  - **Access Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
  - **Authentication (Au):** Single (S)
  - **Impact to Confidentiality (C):** Partial (P)
  - **Impact to Integrity (I)::** None (N)
  - **Impact to Availability (A):** None (N)

**Reason and Prerequisites**
ABAP Workbench does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's permissions to access certain functions. This omission may lead to undesired system behavior and potential privilege escalation.

**Solution**
The correction provided in this SAP Note introduces an additional authorization check `S_DEVELOP` with activity "03" for display operations. To remediate this issue, implement the relevant Support Package or follow the correction instructions outlined in the SAP Note.
