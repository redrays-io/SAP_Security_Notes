2591323 - Security Issue when Exporting to CSV in the Solution Readiness Dashboard

**SAP Security Note 2591323** addresses a critical security vulnerability in the Solution Readiness Dashboard of Focused Build. This issue allows malicious characters to be executed when exporting data from SAP UI5 tables into CSV files in Excel.

### **Symptom**
When exporting data from SAP UI5 tables to CSV files in the Solution Readiness Dashboard, the content of the cells should be checked and properly escaped to prevent the execution of malicious commands. Without the fix, malicious characters could be executed when the CSV file is opened in Excel.

### **Affected Versions**
- **Focused Build 7.1 SP4**
- **Focused Build 7.2 SP0**
- **Focused Build 7.2 SP1**

### **Solution**
To mitigate this security risk, implement the following SAP Notes based on your Focused Build version:

- **For Focused Build 7.1 SP4 or 7.2 SP0:**
  Implement [SAP Note 2393914](https://me.sap.com/notes/2393914).

- **For Focused Build 7.2 SP1:**
  Implement [SAP Note 2591323](https://me.sap.com/notes/2591323).

These notes ensure that any malicious content in CSV exports is prefixed with a `'` character, preventing Excel from interpreting the content as executable commands.
