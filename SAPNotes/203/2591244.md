2591244 - ChaRM users are able to access changes they are not involved in

## Symptom

ChaRM users are able to access changes they are not involved in (e.g., assigned as a business partner to a business function like developer, tester, or change manager).

## Other Terms

ChaRM, CRM_ORD_OP, CRM_ORD_PR

## Solution

Please review the CRM authorization check process as described [here](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_crm70/helpdata/en/48/a44236ceb873e8e10000000a42189b/frameset.htm) and KBAÂ [1615000](https://me.sap.com/notes/1615000).

If, for example, a user is assigned authorization `CRM_ORD_OP` for transactions they are involved in as a partner in a function, but is also assigned authorization `CRM_ORD_PR` to effectively access all assigned transaction types, the `CRM_ORD_OP` authorization might be overruled by `CRM_ORD_PR`.

Another example might be that `CRM_ORD_LP` is assigned, which is the last authorization check done and might overrule all other assignments.
