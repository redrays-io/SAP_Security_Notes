2595262 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SAP CRM WebClient UI

**Overview**
SAP has released Security Note [2595262](https://me.sap.com/notes/2595262) addressing a critical Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the SAP CRM WebClient UI. This vulnerability arises from insufficient encoding of user-controlled inputs, potentially allowing malicious actors to execute unauthorized scripts within the user's browser context.

**Symptom**
The SAP CRM WebClient UI does not adequately encode user inputs, leading to an XSS vulnerability. This can result in:
- **Content Manipulation:** Defacing or modifying website content temporarily.
- **Session Hijacking:** Stealing authentication tokens or session information.
- **User Impersonation:** Gaining unauthorized access with the same privileges as the targeted user.
- **Unauthorized Command Execution:** Executing unintended commands within the application.

**Affected Components**
- **Software Components:** 
  - SAPSCORE (Version 112)
  - S4FND (Version 102)
  - WEBCUIF (Versions 748, 800, 801)

**Solution**
The security note mandates the implementation of input encoding and validation mechanisms within the SAP CRM WebClient UI to mitigate the XSS vulnerability. Customers are advised to apply the provided solution or install the equivalent Support Package to ensure protection against potential exploits.
