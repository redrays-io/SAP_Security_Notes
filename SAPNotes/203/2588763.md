**Title:** [2588763 - [CVE-2019-0244] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SAP CRM WebClient UI](https://me.sap.com/notes/2588763)

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Recency:** New

**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer

### Symptom

SAP CRM WebClient UI does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impacts of XSS vulnerability include:**

- Non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website
- Steal authentication information of the user, such as data relating to their current session
- Impersonate the user and access information with the same rights as the target user
- Unauthorized execution of commands

### Reason and Prerequisites

*CRM WebClient UI does not encode or validate untrusted input. An attacker needs to trick an already authenticated user into visiting a prepared website to launch the attack.*

### Solution

Input encoding and validation have been added.
