2592069 - Missing Authorization check in ABAP in Eclipse

**SAP Security Note 2592069: Missing Authorization check in ABAP in Eclipse**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 13.02.2018  
**Component:** ABAP Source Code editors  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error

### Symptom
ABAP in Eclipse does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in escalation of privileges.

Some well-known impacts of Missing Authorization check are:
- Abuse functionality restricted to a particular user group
- Read, modify, or delete restricted data

### Other Terms
Access control, Authorization error, Authorization profile  
ABAP in Eclipse (AIE), ABAP Development Tools (ADT)

### Reason and Prerequisites
A legitimated user with `S_DEVELOP` is required. The user has only the right to display ABAP source code. Under some circumstances, this user can duplicate a report into `$TMP`. With the duplicated report, it might be possible to leverage the right to execute ABAP reports by choosing a report name that is in the user's list of reports to be executed.

### Solution
The correction closes the gap in the authorization check and performs the standard authorization check for ABAP development.

Please implement the correction instruction of this SAP Note or the mentioned Support Package.
