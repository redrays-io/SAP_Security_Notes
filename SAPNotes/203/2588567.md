SAP Note 2588567 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in SAP CRM WebClient UI

**Title:** 2588567 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SAP CRM WebClient UI

**Symptom**

SAP CRM WebClient UI does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Some well-known impacts of XSS vulnerability are:

- Non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website
- Steal authentication information of the user, such as data relating to their current session
- Impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user
- Unauthorized execution of commands

**Reason and Prerequisites**

*CRM WebClient UI does not encode or validate untrusted input. The attacker needs to trick an already authenticated user to visit a prepared website to launch the attack.*

**Solution**

Input encoding and validation have been added. Please implement the solution below or install the equivalent Support Package.
