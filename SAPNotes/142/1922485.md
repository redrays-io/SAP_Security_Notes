SAP Security Note 1922485: Missing Whitelist Check in EHS-SAF-RCK and EHS-BD-TLS

**Summary**
An authenticated user can exploit functions within the components **EHS-SAF-RCK** and **EHS-BD-TLS** to which access should be restricted, potentially leading to an escalation of privileges. This vulnerability arises due to a program error, specifically the absence of a whitelist check.

**Affected Components**
- **Environment, Health, and Safety / Product Compliance > Basic Data and Tools > Tools (EHS-BD-TLS)**
- **EHS-SAF-RCK**

**Impact**
The lack of a whitelist check allows unauthorized access to sensitive functions, which can be leveraged to gain elevated privileges within the system. This poses a significant security risk, especially in environments handling critical safety and compliance data.

**Solution**
To mitigate this vulnerability, implement the recommended **support package** or follow the **correction instructions** provided in the SAP Security Note. If you are utilizing the report `RC1BOMBOS_FILL_FROM_LO` and have customized it with your own function module, you must create a new environment parameter:

1. Navigate to IMG Activity: **Specify Environment Parameters**.
2. Create a new entry.
3. Insert `BOMBOS_BOMDATA_GET` in the **Environment parameter** field.
4. Enter your custom function module in the **Value** field.
5. Save the changes.
