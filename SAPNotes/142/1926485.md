1926485 - Missing authorization check in application "Edit System Log and Security Audit Log Messages"

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use functions of transaction SE92 to which access should be restricted by the object S_DEVELOP. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 3.6
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/AU:S/C:N/I:P/A:P

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://me.sap.com/service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

SE92 does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access its log event definitions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

1. **Restrict Access to SE92:**
   The usage of transaction SE92 is rarely needed in customer environments. To prevent unwanted access to that transaction, you can lock it using transaction SM01. This lock can be transported with object entry R3TR TRAN SE92.
   
2. **Register Modifications:**
   Changes to log event definitions are connected to the SSCR (after the implementation of note 1673767). A user must register modifications to these objects at the service marketplace. This helps restrict and identify unwanted changes.
   
3. **Implement Correction:**
   Apply the attached correction via SNOTE or a support package. With this fix, the transaction SE92 checks activities on event definitions using the object S_DEVELOP (Objecttype: SYAG, Objectname <event class>, and Activity: Change, Display, Delete). If a correction for your version is unavailable, use the workaround to lock SE92.
