### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functions of Profile Maintenance to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**

CVSS Base Score: 3.5  
CVSS Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

### Other Terms
Authorization, authorization check, Profile Maintenance

### Reason and Prerequisites
Profile Maintenance does not contain authorization checks for checking an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

### Solution
Authorization check on `S_RZL_ADM` is added to these functions.

- Read and write access is checked for activity "01"
- Read-only access in case of an access through an RFC connection checks for activity "03"

Please implement the support package mentioned in this note or implement the corrections of [SAP Note 1580244](https://me.sap.com/notes/1580244), and apply the respective correction instruction of this note.
