1918333 - Missing authorization check in SAP Background Processing

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use functions of SAP Background Processing to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 3.5
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

**Other Terms**

Authorization, authorization check, SAP Background Processing, Batch

**Reason and Prerequisites**

SAP Background Processing does not contain authorization checks for checking an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

Authorization check on `S_RZL_ADM` is added to these functions.

Read and write access is checked for activity "01"; read-only access in case of an access through an RFC connection checks for activity "03".
