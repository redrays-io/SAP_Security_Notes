### Description
**Symptom**

XI SOAP Adapter can be abused by attackers, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3
- **Access Vector (AV):** Network (N)
- **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium (M)
- **Authentication (AU):** None (N)
- **Confidentiality (C):** None (N)
- **Integrity (I):** Partial (P)
- **Availability (A):** None (N)

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/).*

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The XI SOAP Adapter does not sufficiently encode INPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

This issue is fixed with the Support Packages and Patches of the Software Components referenced by this SAP Note.
