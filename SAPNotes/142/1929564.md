- **CVSS Base Vector:**
  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)

*Note:* This CVSS base score is an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. It does not account for your own system configuration or operational environment. Conduct your own risk assessments when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages within BC-WD-ABA do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. It can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Please apply the correction instructions specified in this security note.
