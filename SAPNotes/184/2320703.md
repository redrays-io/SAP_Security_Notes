SAP Security Note 2320703 - Update 1 to Security Note 1512776

**Description**

### Symptom
Enterprise Services Repository (ESR) does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Some well-known impacts of XSS vulnerability include:
- Non-permanently defacing or modifying displayed content from a website
- Stealing authentication information of the user, such as data relating to their current session
- Impersonating the user and accessing all information with the same rights as the target user
