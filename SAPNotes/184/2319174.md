2319174 - Whitelist based Clickjacking Framing Protection in NWBC for HTML

**SAP Security Note 2319174**

**Title:** Whitelist based Clickjacking Framing Protection in NWBC for HTML

**Release Status:** Released for Customer on 19.10.2017

### Symptom
NWBC for HTML does not protect its applications against Clickjacking attacks.

### Other Terms
UI redressing attack, Clickjacking, Framing Protection, Framing, IFrame, UI Redressing, Clickjacking Whitelist, X-FRAME-OPTIONS, NWBC for HTML

### Reason and Prerequisites
Clickjacking is a UI-redressing attack where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different than the user is aware of. This attack leverages standard possibilities in HTML and does not exploit weaknesses in the application's code.

Further details can be found at [OWASP Clickjacking](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking).

### Solution
Standard protection measures against Clickjacking (X-FRAME-OPTIONS header) are not suitable for common NetWeaver integration scenarios. Therefore, SAP provides a whitelist-based framework for NetWeaver technologies. This framework and its implementation are detailed in [SAP Note 2319727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319727).

This SAP Note specifically addresses NWBC for HTML.

### Affected Components
