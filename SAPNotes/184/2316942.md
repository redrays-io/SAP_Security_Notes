2316942 - Missing Authorization check in EWM for delivery / warehouse request objects

**Description**

A user can change delivery/warehouse request objects even if they have no change authorization.

**Other Terms**

Access control, Authorization error, Authorization profile, /SCDL/AF061, /SCDL/AF 061

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The user must at least have display authorization (ACTVT=03). If they do not have this authorization, the above symptom will also not occur.

**Solution**

*Implement the correction instruction.*

As after the correction, more strict authorization checks are in place. This may result in users encountering authorization check errors if they do not have the appropriate authorizations.
