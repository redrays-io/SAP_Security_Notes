SAP Security Note 2319184 - Whitelist based Clickjacking Framing Protection in SAPUI5

**Overview**

**SAP Note Number:** [2319184](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319184)  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Released On:** July 12, 2016  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** [CA-UI5-COR](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319184) - Cross-Application Components > SAPUI5 > Core and Runtime  
**Language:** English

**Description**

SAPUI5 does not utilize the whitelist service for clickjacking framing protection as outlined in [SAP Note 2319727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319727). This service defines rules to protect web applications hosted on an SAP NetWeaver ABAP system from clickjacking attacks.

**Symptom**

The absence of whitelist-based framing protection allows attackers to execute UI redressing attacks, misleading users into interacting with unintended elements of the application without exploiting code vulnerabilities.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Clickjacking involves manipulating the user interface to deceive users into performing unintended actions. Standard protection measures like the `X-FRAME-OPTIONS` header are not adequate for common NetWeaver integration scenarios. Comprehensive details can be found on the [OWASP Clickjacking page](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking).

**Solution**

SAP provides a whitelist-based framework for clickjacking protection tailored for NetWeaver technologies. This framework and its implementation are detailed in [SAP Note 2319727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319727). Specifically, this note addresses the SAPUI5 component, ensuring compatibility with AS ABAP Backend systems. For integrations beyond AS ABAP, refer to the [SAPUI5 Documentation](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319184).

**Manual Activities**

Depending on your support package version, follow the respective manual post-implementation steps to upgrade SAPUI5:
