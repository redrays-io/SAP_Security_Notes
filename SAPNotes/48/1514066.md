1514066 - Overwriting of files in upgrade or EHPI

**SAP Security Note 1514066 - Overwriting of files in upgrade or EHPI**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 9  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 06.02.2018  
**Component:** Basis Components > Upgrade - general (BC-UPG)

### Symptom
This security note is relevant only for newly installed systems or those that have not yet been updated using Software Update Manager 1.0 or 2.0. If you have used Software Update Manager since 2014, set the processing status of this SAP Note to 'Not Relevant'.

Programs of the update tools sometimes create files in the file system of the application server. As a result, the system may access files located in directory areas not intended for this context.

### Reason
The problem is caused by a program design.

### Solution
- **Use the current archive** for performing an upgrade or installing an Enhancement Package (EHP).
- **Check the attached corrections** to determine if they can be implemented in your system. If some objects do not exist, you can ignore the relevant corrections.
- **Manual Adjustment:** Depending on your system's history, the program versions may differ from those assumed in the note, potentially causing errors during automatic implementation. Manually adjust the corrections as needed and ensure changes are implemented appropriately. If unsure, contact SAP Support.
