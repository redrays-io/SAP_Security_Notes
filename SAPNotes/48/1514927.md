1514927 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BW

**Overview**

SAP has released Security Note **1514927** addressing an **Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BW**. This vulnerability pertains to a **Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)** issue within the **SAP Business Warehouse (BW)** component, specifically in **BW-BEX-OT**.

**Details**

- **Symptom:**  
  A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to modify displayed application content without proper authorization and potentially steal authentication information from other legitimate users.

  - SAP_BW (Versions 30B to 730)
  - SAP_BW_VIRTUAL_COMP (Version 30B and 701)
