SAP Security Note 1514483 - Unauthorized usage of application functionality in EA-HR

**Description**

A malicious user can trigger functionality in EA-HR without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**

Cross-Site Request Forgery, XSRF, EA-HRGXX, EA-HRRXX.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

EA-HR executes certain functions through referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the user.

If present, the attacker may use a Cross Site Scripting attack to trigger the exploit, or use an approach in which a link to click is presented to the victim.

**Solution**

1. Refer to [Note 1481392](https://me.sap.com/notes/1481392) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from this note are a prerequisite for implementing this note.

2. Implement the correction instructions of this note. This will also create the report `RH_XSRF_PARAM_EA_HR_ITS` (or `RH_XSRF_PARAM_EAHR_ITS` in Release 500) in your system.

3. Execute the report in the development system and specify a corresponding transport request number when prompted. The report will add service parameters for the adapted ITS services (maintained via the GUI configuration pushbutton for a service within transaction SICF).
