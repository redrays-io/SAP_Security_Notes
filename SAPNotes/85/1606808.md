### **Description**

An authenticated user can use functionality of an obsolete RFC to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an Escalation of Privileges.

**CVSS Information**  
CVSS Base Score: 3.5  
CVSS Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### **Reason and Prerequisites**

RFC in BC-WB lacks permission checks for an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functionality. This may result in undesired system behavior.
