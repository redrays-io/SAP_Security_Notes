### Other Terms

### Reason and Prerequisites
Web Dynpro for Java based application results in a stored cross-site scripting issue. It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a Web site, allowing the malicious user to embed content that is rendered automatically, without having to target victims individually. Stored cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
