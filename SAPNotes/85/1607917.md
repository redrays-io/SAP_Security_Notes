SAP Security Note 1607917 - Missing authorization check in RFC API of ABAP Workbench

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functions of the RFC API of the ABAP Workbench to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**
- **Base Score:** 3.5
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

**Description**
The RFC API of the ABAP Workbench lacks proper authorization checks for certain functions. This oversight allows authenticated users to access functionalities that should be restricted, potentially leading to unauthorized privilege escalation and undesired system behavior.

**Impact**
Exploiting this vulnerability can allow an attacker with authenticated access to perform actions beyond their intended permissions, compromising the integrity of the system.

**Solution**
Apply the support package mentioned in this note, specifically the following:
- **For SAP_APPL 45B:** Apply Support Package `SAPKH45B67` ([More Info](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKH45B67))
- **For SAP_BASIS 46C:** Apply Support Package `SAPKB46C63` ([More Info](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB46C63))

Additionally, create the exception `NOT_AUTHORIZED` for the following function modules before implementing the coding changes:
- `RFC_READ_DYNPRO`
- `RFC_READ_REPORT`
- `RFC_READ_DEVELOPMENT_OBJECT`
