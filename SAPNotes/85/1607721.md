1607721 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in Unicode Co

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Release Status:** Released for Customer on 13.09.2011

### Description

#### Symptom
Web Access to Unicode Conversion can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, Web Access to Unicode Conversion

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within Web Access to Unicode Conversion do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

#### Solution
Please apply the support package mentioned in this note at least, or the respective correction instruction.
