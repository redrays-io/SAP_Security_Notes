### Title
**1607299 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in PI Demo**

### Description

#### Symptom
PI Demo Example can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
cross-site scripting, XSS, PI Demo Example

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within PI Demo Examples do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

#### Solution
The application is known as a PI Demo Application; by default, it's not active and cannot be accessed. Only if the PI demo examples are configured—which is not allowed in productive systems—can a user execute these pages.

As a workaround, you can deactivate the demo application in transaction SICF as it is by default. In this case, the pages cannot be accessed using the URL.

Otherwise, import the relevant support package or implement the correction instructions from this note.

The corrections from [Note 822881](https://me.sap.com/notes/822881) are a prerequisite for implementing this note.

As a first step, you need to delete the user and password settings for this application in transaction SICF, and set the client information to 105.
