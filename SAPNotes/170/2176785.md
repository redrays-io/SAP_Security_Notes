New SAP Security Note 2176785: Unauthorized modification of displayed content in Java Monitoring

**SAP Security Note 2176785: Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in Java Monitoring**

**Description**

AS Java Monitoring can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3 / 10
- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Medium (M)
- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)
- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)
- **Scope (S):** Unchanged
- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** None (N)
- **Integrity Impact (I):** Partial (P)
- **Availability Impact (A):** None (N)

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://support.sap.com/securitynotes) at SAP Security Notes.*

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages within AS Java Monitoring do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected XSS attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected XSS can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Update your SAP AS Java to the recommended Support Package or Support Package Patch level, where the issue is fixed.

For more information about the affected releases, see the "SP Patch Level" section of this SAP note. For more information about the SP Stack schedule and updates, see [Support Package Stacks Maintenance Schedule](http://service.sap.com/swdc).
