## Other Terms

Buffer overflow, RCE, remote code execution, SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author, SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Generator, SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer

## Reason and Prerequisites

Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in shared components used by SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author, Generator, and Viewer. This enables an attacker to inject code into the working memory that is subsequently executed by the application. It can also be used to cause a general fault in the product, causing the product to terminate.

## Solution

**Workaround:**

The injected code cannot be executed when Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is enabled. All SAP 3D Visual Enterprise products, including Author, Generator, and Viewer, are explicitly marked for DEP, the flag is permanently set and the user does not have to perform any additional steps to enable it. Protection in all SAP 3D Visual Enterprise products also does not depend on system-wide settings. DEP is available on all modern supported CPUs.

More information about DEP on Windows platform is available at:
- [Microsoft TechNet](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738483(v=ws.10).aspx)
- [Microsoft Support KB899298](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/899298)

Additionally, as a precaution the user should only load models and drawings received from trusted sources.

**Fix target version:**
- SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author 8.0 SP3 MP1
- SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Generator 8.0 SP3 MP1
- SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer 8.0 SP3 MP1
