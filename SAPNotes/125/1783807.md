**SAP Security Note 1783807 - Missing authorization checks in CA-CL**

**Description:**
An authenticated user can use functions of CA-CL to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Symptom:**
CA-CL does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access certain functions. This oversight can lead to unauthorized access and undesired system behavior.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
The absence of proper authorization checks in CA-CL allows users to perform actions beyond their intended permissions, potentially compromising system security.

**Solution:**
Implement the correction instructions provided in the SAP Security Note. Follow these steps to apply the necessary authorization checks:
