**SAP Security Note 1782959 - Directory traversal in XX-CSC-BR**

**Symptom**
Potential Directory Traversal in
- XX-CSC-BR

**Read-write or write directory traversal:**
The function group contained in the correction instructions contains a vulnerability through which an attacker can potentially write arbitrary files to the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

**Other Terms**
Directory traversal, XX-CSC-BR

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Read-write or write directory traversal:
The function group contained in the correction instruction fails to correctly validate the path to which a user-submitted file is written. As a result, an attacker can potentially overwrite data in the remote system.

**Solution**
Please refer to [note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from note 1497003 are a prerequisite to implement this note.

**Logical File Names Used in this Solution**
No specific logical file name was created to test the solution because, since this is a generic framework for creation of SPED reports, the logical file name used for the validation will come as an input from the report that uses these functionalities.

**Logical File Paths Used in this Solution**
No specific logical file path was created to test the solution because, since this is a generic framework for creation of SPED reports, the logical file path used for the validation **should have been configured before the logical file name**.

**Recommendations for Setup of Logical File Names**
When you set the output report to the Application Server, the logical file should be configured.

As a general rule, SAP recommends that you install a solution by applying a Support Package. However, if you need to install a solution earlier, use the Note Assistant to implement the correction instruction. You can find more information about the Note Assistant in SAP Service Marketplace, under [service.sap.com/note-assistant](https://me.sap.com/note-assistant).

**Manual Activities**
```plaintext
Change Function Module "J_1BSPED_OUTPUT_LIST"
- Execute transaction "SE37";
- Enter "J_1BSPED_OUTPUT_LIST" in the proper field;
- Choose "Change" pushbutton;
- Choose 'Import' tab;
- Enter the following information as follows:
    - Parameter Name: "IV_LOG_FILEPATH";
    - Typing: "TYPE";
    - Associated Type: "DXFILENAME";
    - Check "Optional" checkbox;
    - Short text: "Logical file path";
Save and activate.
```
