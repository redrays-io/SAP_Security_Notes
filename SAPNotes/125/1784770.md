1784770 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CR Server

**SAP Security Note 1784770** addresses a security vulnerability in the XIr3 Infoview web application that allows unauthorized modification of displayed content and potential theft of authentication information.

### **Symptom**
The XIr3 Infoview web application can be abused by an attacker, enabling them to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability may also allow attackers to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### **CVSS Information**
- **Base Score:** 3.5
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:N/I:P/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue. It is recommended to conduct your own risk assessments based on your system configuration and operational environment.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
Pages within XIr3 do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This can be exploited to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on a website or steal another user's authentication information, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate the user and access information with the same permissions.

### **Solution**
Customers should install **FixPack 4.3** or **FixPack 5.3** to address this issue.
