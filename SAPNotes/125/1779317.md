1779317 - Missing authorization check in HR Distributed-Reporting - CE

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use functions of HR Distributed-Reporting to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 7.5
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security.

**Other Terms**

Authorization, authorization check, Reporting in Distributed Systems, PA-PA-US

**Reason and Prerequisites**

HR Distributed-Reporting does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.
