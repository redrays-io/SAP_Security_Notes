2201796 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in Authentication framework

**Description**

**Symptom**
The AS Java Authentication framework can be exploited by an attacker, allowing unauthorized modification of displayed application content and potentially accessing authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
- Header Manipulation
- Authentication

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The AS Java Authentication framework does not sufficiently encode output headers, leading to vulnerabilities that allow header manipulation. This can be used to non-permanently deface or modify content displayed on a website.

**Solution**
Update your AS Java to a Support Package (SP) or release where this issue is resolved. Refer to the "Validity" and "Support Package Patches" sections of this note for detailed information and available patches.
