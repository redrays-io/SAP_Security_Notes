2198151 - Potential false redirection of web site content in Internet Communication of AS ABAP

## Symptom

Internet Communication of AS ABAP can be exploited for phishing attacks by allowing an attacker to publish a URL that appears to be from the product, which redirects victims to a malicious URL of the attacker's choosing. This enables attackers to gain victims' trust falsely and elicit private data such as authentication information.

## CVSS Information

- **CVSS Base Score:** 5.8 / 10
- **CVSS Vector:**

## Reason and Prerequisites

Some pages within Internet Communication of AS ABAP allow cross-domain redirection. An attacker can include a URL from a different domain in a target application's URL, which is then sent to a user. The user believes the content is from the target application, but it is actually delivered from the attacker's domain. This can be exploited to mimic pages of the target application (e.g., logon pages) to trick the victim into disclosing sensitive information like passwords.

## Solution

Implement the patch level mentioned in this SAP Note. The correction in Internet Communication Manager prevents requests passed to the AS ABAP application from being constructed in a way that references attacker-chosen domains. Content references will remain within the intended AS ABAP system.
