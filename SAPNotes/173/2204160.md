### Description

#### Symptom

SAPUI5 can be exploited by an attacker to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability may also allow attackers to obtain authentication information from legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score**: 4.3 / 10
- **Attack Vector**: Network (N)
- **Access Complexity**: Medium (M)
- **Authentication Required**: None (N)
- **Confidentiality Impact**: None (N)
- **Integrity Impact**: Partial (P)
- **Availability Impact**: None (N)

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue. It is recommended to conduct your own risk assessments.*

#### Reason and Prerequisites

The Support Tool within SAPUI5 does not sufficiently encode input parameters, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this to deface or modify displayed content and steal authentication information, potentially compromising the security of the application.
