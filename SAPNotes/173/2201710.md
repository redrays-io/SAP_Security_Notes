2201710 - Fixing Logjam and Alternative chains certificate forgery vulnerabilities in multiple SAP products

# SAP Security Note 2201710: Addressing Logjam and Certificate Forgery Vulnerabilities

**SAP Security Note 2201710** resolves critical vulnerabilities known as **Logjam (CVE-2015-4000)** and **Alternative chains certificate forgery (CVE-2015-1793)** affecting multiple SAP products. These vulnerabilities pose significant security risks by enabling attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and bypass certificate verification mechanisms.

## Symptom

Systems utilizing client or server components that communicate with SAP Sybase products using SSL/TLS Diffie-Hellman key exchange and certificate verification functionalities are susceptible to these vulnerabilities.

## CVSS Information

- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 5.4/10

| Metric                  | Value           |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Attack Vector (AV)**  | Network (N)     |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | Low (L)     |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None (N)  |
| **User Interaction (UI)** | Required (R) |
| **Scope (S)**           | Unchanged (U)   |
| **Confidentiality Impact (C)** | Low (L) |
| **Integrity Impact (I)**       | Low (L) |
| **Availability Impact (A)**    | None (N)|

## Reason and Prerequisites

- **Logjam (CVE-2015-4000):** Exploits a vulnerability in the TLS protocol allowing attackers to downgrade secure connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography.
  
- **Alternative Chains Certificate Forgery (CVE-2015-1793):** Targets certificate verification processes in OpenSSL, enabling attackers to bypass critical certificate checks and potentially issue fraudulent certificates.

## Solution

SAP has released fixes for the affected products. It is imperative to update to the specified fixed versions to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
