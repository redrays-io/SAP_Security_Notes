#### CVSS Information
**CVSS Base Score:** 4.3 / 10  
**CVSS Base Vector:**

| Key                                                             | Value          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| AV : Access Vector (Related exploit range)                      | Network (N)    |
| AC : Access Complexity (Required attack complexity)             | Medium (M)     |
| Au : Authentication (Level of authentication needed to exploit)| None (N)       |
| C : Impact to Confidentiality                                   | None (N)       |

**Note:** This CVSS base score is an estimate of the risk posed by the issue and does not account for specific system configurations or environments.

#### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, RWB

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Web pages within 'Process Integration Runtime Workbench' do not sufficiently encode URL parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. This vulnerability can be exploited to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content and steal authentication information, potentially allowing attackers to impersonate users with the same rights.

#### Solution
Please update the software components of your system to the patch levels maintained in the "SP Patch Level" section of this note or use newer versions to fix the described security vulnerability.
