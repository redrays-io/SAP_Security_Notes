1654492 - Unauthorized modification of content in gATP pop-up

**SAP Security Note 1654492 - Unauthorized modification of content in gATP pop-up**

**Symptom**
The global availability to promise (gATP) pop-up in the CRM WebClient UI can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
- Reflected cross-site-scripting (XSS)
- BTGATP
- gATP
- Global ATP

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The gATP pop-up within the CRM WebClient UI component BTGATP does not sufficiently encode the URL for displaying ATP results, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
- Non-permanently deface or modify displayed content on the website.
- Steal another user's authentication information, such as session data.
- Impersonate users, potentially compromising application security, especially if an administrator is targeted.
