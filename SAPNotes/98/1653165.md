1653165 - Unauthorized use of application functions in Intercompany

**SAP Security Note 1653165** addresses a critical vulnerability in the Intercompany application that allows unauthorized execution of functions without proper authentication and authorization.

### **Description**

**Symptom**
An attacker can execute functions in Intercompany without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
Cross-site request forgery (XSRF/CSRF), Intercompany.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Intercompany executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. An attacker can trick an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing these URLs and specific parameters, causing the function to execute with the user's privileges. This can be achieved through cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or by presenting a malicious link to the victim.

### **Solution**
XSRF protection has been implemented in the following service packages:
- **IC 10 SP06**
- **IC 7.5 SP17**
