1504090 - Code injection vulnerability in SCM-APO-PPS

**Description:**

### Symptom
SCM-APO-PPS contains code that allows the execution of arbitrary program code chosen by the user. A malicious user can control the system's behavior or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without legitimate credentials.

### Other Terms
Backdoor, injection, run, credentials, SCM-APO-PPS, Security Note, Security Issue, Security Problem, Vulnerability, Exploit

### Reason and Prerequisites
The program code allows the definition and execution of user-supplied code, altering the system's behavior. A valid and authenticated user is required. Depending on the injected code, a user can:
- Inject and run their own code
- Obtain additional sensitive information
- Modify or delete data
- Alter system output
- Create new users with higher privileges
- Perform denial of service attacks

### Solution
The obsolete code line has been removed. Implement the necessary source code corrections to address the vulnerability.
