1504490 - SAP GUI Security: Enhancements as of patchlevel 3

**SAP Security Note 1504490: SAP GUI Security Enhancements (Patchlevel 3)**

*Released on: December 14, 2010*

**Overview:**

This security note addresses enhancements made in Patchlevel 3 of SAP GUI for Windows 7.20. Previous patches (0 through 2) left some security gaps, including potential attack vectors and information disclosure under certain conditions. Patchlevel 3 aims to close these gaps by implementing additional security functionalities.

**Key Enhancements:**

- **Expanded Security Functions:** Prevents attack scenarios such as the instantiation of unauthorized controls within SAP GUI and restricts read access to resources on the end user's workstation.

- **Blacklist Capability:** Enables the creation of blacklists to explicitly deny certain actions triggered by the server without user prompts.

- **Default Deny Actions:** Actions not explicitly allowed by a rule are automatically declined (default action set to "Deny").

- **Logging Functionality:** Allows administrators to collect information on objects routinely accessed by users, aiding in the configuration of the security module.

**Implications:**

Some actions that previously did not prompt a security popup will now trigger one. To minimize unnecessary popups, administrators are advised to configure SAP GUI for Windows security rules tailored to their environment, such as trusting specific custom ActiveX controls.

Additionally, a new mechanism informs users when an action is automatically denied by SAP GUI, ensuring potential attacks are noticed and providing sufficient information to resolve issues arising from incorrectly defined "deny" rules.
