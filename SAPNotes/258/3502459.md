3502459 - [CVE-2025-0056] Information Disclosure vulnerability in SAP GUI for Java

---

**Description**

**Symptom**

SAP GUI for Java saves user input on the client PC to improve usability. An attacker with administrative privileges or access to the victimâ€™s user directory on the Operating System level would be able to read this data. Depending on the user input provided in transactions, the disclosed data could range from non-critical data to highly sensitive data, causing high impact on the confidentiality of the application.

**Other Terms**

Information Exposure, Information Leak, [CVE-2025-0056](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0056)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Accessing the input history database requires strong authorizations on the client PC or server where the attacked user is operating. Typically, administrative privileges are needed, or the user must be tricked into providing access. Additionally, the input history is only stored if not deactivated by the respective application.

**Solution**

The issue has been fixed by encrypting input history data on the client-side. Please apply the SAP GUI for Java patches mentioned in this SAP Security Note.
