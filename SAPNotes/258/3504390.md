3504390 - [CVE-2024-47586] NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform

**Symptom**
  
SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a maliciously crafted HTTP request which could cause a null pointer dereference in the kernel. This dereference will result in the system crashing and rebooting, causing the system to be temporarily unavailable. Sending this request repeatedly can make the application completely unavailable. There is no impact on Confidentiality or Integrity.

**Change Log**

- **v9 (Current version) - UPDATE 10th December 2024:** This note has been re-released with updated *CVSS score* and *Symptom* information.
- **v6 (Initial Version)**

**Other Terms**

- Null Pointer Dereference
- [CVE-2024-47586](https://cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47586)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

SAP Kernel has a null pointer dereference error.

**Solution**

The null pointer dereference issue is solved with a correction in SAP Kernel. Please implement the respective SAP Kernel.

This correction is initially delivered with the kernel patch level listed in the "**Support Package Patches**" section of this [SAP Note 3504390](https://me.sap.com/notes/3504390?language=en-US). All subsequent kernel patch levels also contain the correction. Keep in mind that only the latest kernel patch level is available for download; however, it contains all previously delivered corrections. As a result, you can download and install the latest available kernel patch at any time to implement this correction.

This correction is delivered with the following kernel archives:

- **hotfix** - file: dw.sar
- **SP Stack Kernel** - files SAPEXE.SAR and SAPEXEDB.SAR

**Follow the SAP recommendations on how to select and install the kernel patch:**

1. Apply the latest **SP Stack Kernel** if it contains the correction (PL of correction is smaller or equal to the PL of the latest SP Stack Kernel). For the list of current SP Stack Kernels, see [SAP Note 2083594](https://me.sap.com/notes/2083594) (*SAP Kernel Versions and SAP Kernel Patch Levels*).
2. Otherwise, the next SP Stack Kernel will deliver the correction. Apply the **hotfix** only if you require the correction on short notice.
3. The correction may not be available for kernel releases that are out of maintenance. Please upgrade to the corresponding downward compatible kernel (**DCK**), see [SAP Note 2083594](https://me.sap.com/notes/2083594) (*SAP Kernel Versions and SAP Kernel Patch Levels*).
4. Review the **regression note** for the target patch level before installing the patch. For details, see [SAP Note 1802333](https://me.sap.com/notes/1802333) (*Finding information about regressions in the SAP kernel*).
5. For instructions on how to download and install kernel patches, see [SAP Note 19466](https://me.sap.com/notes/19466) (*Downloading SAP kernel patches*).

The paper [Update Strategy for the Kernel of the Application Server ABAP in On Premise Landscapes](https://support.sap.com/deployment-strategies-kernel-abap.pdf) provides detailed SAP recommendations.
