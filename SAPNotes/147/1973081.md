SAP Security Note 1973081 - XSRF vulnerability: External start of transactions with OKCode

```markdown
### Symptom

An attacker can trick a victim user to execute an SAP GUI shortcut (SAP GUI for Windows), a Java start transaction (SAP GUI for Java) or to click the link (SAP GUI for HTML) and execute a state-changing action in the system with the credentials of the victim.

### Other Terms

- Cross-site request forgery, XSRF

### Reason and Prerequisites

The XSRF protection for BSP provided by [SAP Notes 1458171](https://me.sap.com/notes/1458171) and [1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324), and ITS provided by [SAP Note 1481392](https://me.sap.com/notes/1481392) shall be implemented. A generic solution is required and provided by this SAP Note in the solution area.

### Solution

With this SAP Note we introduce switchable white lists to enable administrators to implement XSRF protection across the input channels. The white list mechanism is implemented in SAP backend and may replace input channel specific solutions.

White listing is available in NetWeaver 740 SP08 and for releases 700 to 731 by [SAP Note 2055468](https://me.sap.com/notes/2055468), for documentation refer to [SAP Note 1956086](https://me.sap.com/notes/1956086).

Further on, a learning mode assists administrators to maintain white lists, for details refer to [SAP Notes 1919573](https://me.sap.com/notes/1919573) (implementation) and [1922712](https://me.sap.com/notes/1922712) (documentation).
