**Title:** 1972093 - Untrusted XML input parsing possible in BI4

## Description

### Symptom
A malicious user can modify an XML-based request to include XML content that is then parsed locally. This could allow a malicious user to perform a denial of service (DoS) on the parsing system, disclose local data that is then returned in the response to the malicious request, or access further network-located resources accessible from the parsing system.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.0
- **Access Vector (AV):** Network (N)
- **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium (M)
- **Authentication (AU):** Single (S)
- **Confidentiality (C):** Partial (P)
- **Integrity (I):** Partial (P)
- **Availability (A):** Partial (P)

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. It does not account for your system configuration or operational environment and should not replace your own risk assessments.

**Other Terms:**  
XXE, XML eXternal Entity, information disclosure, denial of service, DoS

### Reason and Prerequisites
The issue is caused by a program error due to the incorrect use of an XML parser. Insufficient input filtering can lead to malicious content being parsed, which can reference internal resources such as files. These internal resources can be disclosed in responses or used to perform DoS attacks on the parsing system, rendering application content temporarily unavailable.

The issue is resolved in the following releases:

- **BI 4.0 SP08 Patch 9** and above
- **BI 4.0 SP09 Patch 6** and above
