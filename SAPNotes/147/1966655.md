1966655 - Potential denial of service in ICM

**Description**

### Symptom
An attacker can remotely exploit the Internet Communication Manager (ICM), rendering it, and potentially the resources that are used to serve the ICM or application server, unavailable.

### CVSS Information
- **CVSS Base Score:** 7.1
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:N/A:C

### Other Terms
- DoS, denial of service, ICM

### Reason and Prerequisites
The problem is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can launch a specifically crafted request that causes the process to consume excessive resources. As a result, no other processes can allocate new resources, rendering the system unavailable. This condition can be intentionally provoked by an attacker to cause a denial of service.

### Solution
Apply the kernel patch level specified in this SAP Note and configure the ICM in accordance with [SAP Note 1981955](https://me.sap.com/notes/1981955). Alternatively, you can also use an upstream SAP Web Dispatcher with a corresponding configuration to protect the system.
