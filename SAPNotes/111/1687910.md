### **Symptom**

This security note has been updated. For more detailed information, see [Security Note 1658025](https://me.sap.com/notes/1658025).

### **CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 5.1  
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/).

---

### **Reason and Prerequisites**

The problem is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can launch a specifically crafted request that causes the process to consume excessive resources. As a result, no other processes can allocate new resources, rendering the system unavailable. This condition can be intentionally provoked by an attacker to cause a denial of service.

---

### **Solution**

Please apply the patch level of the SAP kernel (disp+work) mentioned in this note at least.

For the installation of the downward compatible kernel (DCK) release 7.20, see [SAP Note 1636252](https://me.sap.com/notes/1636252) for details.
