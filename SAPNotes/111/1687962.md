1687962 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in Calendar

**Description**

**Symptom**

CRM PCUI Calendar or CRM IC WebClient UI Calendar can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users. Cross site scripting security issues in CRM BSP applications CRM_CALENDAR and BSP_CAL_APP.

**Other Terms**

Cross site scripting, XSS, library, calendar, CRM calendar, security, encoding, PCUI, PC UI, Reflected cross-site scripting, CRM PCUI Calendar, PCUI Calendar, CRM IC WebClient UI Calendar.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages and API interfaces within CRM Calendar do not sufficiently encode input and output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

Implement the attached automatic correction instructions.
