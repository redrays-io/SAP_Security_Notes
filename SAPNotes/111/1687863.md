**SAP Security Note 1687863: Unauthorized Access of Document Possible in PPM-PFM**

**Summary**

This SAP Security Note addresses a vulnerability in the Portfolio and Project Management - Portfolio Management (PPM-PFM) component that allows unauthorized access to documents and potential information leakage through URL parameter manipulation.

**Details**

- **SAP Note Number:** 1687863
- **Type:** SAP Security Note

**Vulnerability Description**

An attacker can exploit PPM-PFM to modify displayed application content without authorization. Specifically, the URL parameter `NO_AUTH_CHECK` appears to disable authorization checks, allowing malicious users to bypass authority checks by appending this parameter to URLs.

Additionally, `CL_RPM_FILE_HTTP_HANDLER` within PPM-PFM insufficiently encodes input parameters, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability can be used to deface web content, steal user authentication information, and impersonate users, including administrators, thereby compromising application security.

**Impact**

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can:

- Modify and deface displayed content.
- Steal authentication information from legitimate users.
- Impersonate users, potentially gaining full administrative access.

**Solution**

Implement the corrections provided with this SAP Note to address the vulnerability.
