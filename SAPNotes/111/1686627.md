**SAP Security Note 1686627 - Unauthorized Modification on Document URL in PPM**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.05.2012  
**Component:** Portfolio and Project Management > Portfolio Management (PPM-PFM)  
**Language:** English

### **Symptom**
The PPM Application can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### **Other Terms**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- PPM-PFM

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
In the PPM application, insufficient OUTPUT encoding is performed, which may result in cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Cross-site scripting can be exploited to steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
