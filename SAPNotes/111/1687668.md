1687668 - Unauthorized modification in BSP application in PE-LSO-LPO

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Released On:** 18.12.2013  
**Component:** Training and Event Management > SAP Learning Solution > Learning Portal  

### Symptom
BSP application `HCM_LEARNING` can be abused by a malicious user, allowing unauthorized modification of displayed application content and potentially obtaining authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- PE-LSO-LPO

### Reason and Prerequisites
BSP Pages (e.g., `trainingtype.htm`, `training.htm`, `traininggroup.htm`) within BSP application `HCM_LEARNING` do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This vulnerability can be exploited to steal another user's authentication information, such as current session data, enabling an attacker to impersonate the user and access information with the same privileges.

If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution
Apply this note or import the changes via the relevant support package.

The correction includes a switch of the HTMLB-design for the following application:
1. **HCM_LEARNING**

The design defines how the application is rendered. If the application was using **CLASSIC** or **DESIGN2002**, it will now use **DESIGN2003**. There will be no impact on the functionality of your application. Switching to the new design is necessary due to compatibility reasons that were not fulfilled by CLASSIC and DESIGN2002.
