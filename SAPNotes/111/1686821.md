1686821 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in SLC-SUP

**SAP Security Note 1686821: Unauthorized modification of displayed content in SLC-SUP**

**Description**
The application component **SLC-QUA** can be exploited by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization. This vulnerability may also allow the attacker to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
- Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
- BSP Extension

**Reason and Prerequisites**
BSP applications using an extension tag depend on proper encoding. Missing or improper encoding within an extension can lead to XSS vulnerabilities in the BSP applications utilizing the extension.

Specifically, the BSP tags of the extensions `/SRMSMC/QL_EXT` and `/SRMSMC/FRONTEND/` may be vulnerable to misuse through client modifications due to the absence of encoding for **all** attribute values passed to these extensions.
