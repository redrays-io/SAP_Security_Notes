1909858 - Missing whitelist check in CA-GTF-WFM

**SAP Security Note 1909858**

- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Version:** 3
- **Released On:** December 10, 2013
- **Component:** CA-GTF-WFM (Cross-Application Components > General Application Functions > Workforce Management Core)
- **Category:** Program error
- **Priority:** Correction with high priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer

### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functions of CA-GTF-WFM to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### CVSS Information
- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.0
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

> **Note:** SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct.

### Reason and Prerequisites
CA-GTF-WFM does not contain required checks against a positive set of allowed functions (i.e., whitelist) during the execution of these functions. This is necessary to verify that authenticated users are permitted to access these functions. The absence of this check may lead to undesired system behavior.

### Solution
Implement the following correction instructions:

1. **Correction Instruction 1**
2. **Correction Instruction 2**
