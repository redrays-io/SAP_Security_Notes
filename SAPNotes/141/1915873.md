**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority

### Symptom

The CRR framework contains code that alters the program's behavior when a user is successfully authenticated with a certain username. An attacker can authenticate to the CRR framework without legitimate credentials or potentially escalate privileges. This vulnerability affects SAP's internal use and is not present in customer systems.

**CVSS Information**  
- **Base Score:** 4.9  
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:N/I:P/A:P  

*Note:* The CVSS score provided is an estimate and does not account for your specific system configuration or environment. Perform your own risk assessment to determine the applicability and priority of this security note. More information is available in the [FAQs](https://me.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Reason and Prerequisites

The program contains a hard-coded username that modifies system behavior upon successful authentication. Attackers can leverage this to log in without legitimate access or escalate privileges if the hard-coded account has higher access rights. This issue is due to a hard-coded username and password combination in the source code.

### Solution

Delete the problematic code. The fix is available in SUM SP08 Patch #10 and SUM SP09 Patch #0.

**Manual Activities:**  
1. Extract the attached SAR archive to `DIR_TRANS`.
