### Symptom
An authenticated user can use FS-RI functions to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### Reason and Prerequisites
FS-RI does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access certain functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

### Solution
Implement the authorization checks as outlined in the SAP Note. This involves executing several manual pre-implementation steps using transaction SE11 to create and modify database views and search helps.

### Manual Pre-Implementation Steps
