1915920 - Missing authorization check in FS-RI

**Summary**

SAP Security Note **1915920** addresses a critical issue in the **Financial Services > Re-Insurance > Accounting > Risk Manager (FS-RI-AC-RM)** component. An authenticated user could access restricted functions, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can utilize functions within FS-RI that should be restricted. This vulnerability may result in an escalation of privileges, allowing unauthorized actions within the system.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The FS-RI component lacks proper authorization checks for certain functions. This omission can lead to undesired system behavior, as unauthorized users might gain access to sensitive operations without appropriate permissions.

**Solution**

The security note implements necessary authorization checks to ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions can access sensitive functions within FS-RI. Applying this note mitigates the risk of privilege escalation by enforcing strict access controls.
