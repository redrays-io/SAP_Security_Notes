1909770 - Missing whitelist check in SAP Collections Management

**Symptom**

An authenticated user can use functions of SAP Collections Management to send correspondence from process receivables to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.0
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

SAP Collections Management while sending correspondence from process receivables does not contain required checks against a positive set of allowed functions (i.e., whitelist) during the execution of these functions. This is required to verify that authenticated users are allowed to access these functions. The missing check may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**

Implement the correction instructions. The manual activity described here is optional. Without the manual correction, the system will just display the message number "UDM_MSG:219".

**Manual Activity:**

1. Call transaction SE91.
2. In the field "Message class", enter `UDM_MSG`.
3. In the field "Number", enter `219`.
4. Press "Change".
5. Enter the message text: `&1 is not in whitelist`.
6. Press "Save" (Ctrl+S).
