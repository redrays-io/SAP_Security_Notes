1509235 - Directory Traversal in RFC modules in classification

**SAP Security Note 1509235** addresses a directory traversal vulnerability in the RFC modules of the classification component. This vulnerability allows a malicious user to potentially write arbitrary files on the remote server, which can lead to data corruption or alteration of system behavior.

### Symptom
The RFC modules in classification (function group CLBA) have a vulnerability that permits directory traversal, enabling unauthorized file writes on the remote server.

### Reason and Prerequisites
Function modules `CLBA_CLASSIF_FILE_REMOTE_HOST` and `CLBA_UPDATE_FILE_REMOTE_HOST` do not properly validate the path for user-submitted files. This oversight allows attackers to overwrite data on the remote system.

**Prerequisites:**
- SAP_ABA component versions 702 and 730
- Installed before applying this note:
  - [SAP Note 1441392](https://me.sap.com/notes/1441392) - Error handling RCCLBI03 and CLAP_DDB_DELETE_CLASSIFICATION
  - [SAP Note 1453844](https://me.sap.com/notes/1453844) - RCCLBI03: Too much memory consumption
  - [SAP Note 1499042](https://me.sap.com/notes/1499042) - Directory Traversal in batch input reports in class system
  - [SAP Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) - Potential directory traversals in applications

### Solution
Implement the changes as outlined in the advance correction. Additionally, refer to [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) for prerequisite program changes required by this note.
