1509014 - Unauthorized usage of application functionality in PA-ER

**SAP Security Note 1509014** - *Unauthorized usage of application functionality in PA-ER*

**Symptom**
A malicious user can trigger functionality in PA-ER without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
Cross-Site Request Forgery, XSRF, PA-ER

**Reason and Prerequisites**
PA-ER executes certain functions through referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated userâ€™s browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the user.

If present, the attacker may use a Cross Site Scripting attack to trigger the exploit, or use an approach in which a link to click is presented to the victim.

**Solution**
The correction will be delivered with a Support Package.

*Alternatively, you can implement the correction instructions:*

1. Refer to [note 1520324](https://me.sap.com/notes/1520324) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from note 1520324 are a prerequisite for implementation of this note.
2. Implement the correction instructions of this note. This will also create the report RCF_BSP_XSRF_PARAM_TRANSPORT in your system.
3. Execute the report in your development system and specify a corresponding transport request number when prompted. The report will fill the database table BSPTEMPXSRFSTORE with corresponding table entries for the BSP applications adapted by this note.
