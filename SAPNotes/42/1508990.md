## Title
**1508990 - Code injection vulnerability in package SDB2**

## Description

### Symptom
Package SDB2 contains code which allows to execute arbitrary program code of the user's choice.  
A malicious user can therefore control the behavior of the system or can potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without legitimate own credentials.

### Other Terms

### Reason and Prerequisites
The program code contains a possibility to define and execute code of the user's choice which changes the system's behavior. A valid and authenticated user is required. Depending on the code the user can inject and run their own code, the user may obtain additional information which should not be displayed, they may be able to modify data, delete data, modify the output of the system, or create new users with higher privileges or perform a denial of service attack.
