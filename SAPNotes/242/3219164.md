A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Portal (KMC). The KMC servlet does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, making it susceptible to XSS attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the user's data.
