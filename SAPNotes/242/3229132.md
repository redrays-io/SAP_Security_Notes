3229132 - [CVE-2022-39013] Information Disclosure vulnerability in SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (Program Objects)

**Symptom**

**UPDATE 13th December 2022**: This note has been re-released with updated 'Solution’ information. We have updated the workaround information.

Under certain conditions, an attacker can gain access to OS credentials. The attacker must be authenticated:

- **Administrator** sees credentials in clear text.
- **Normal user** sees credentials in encrypted form.

Access to OS credentials enables the attacker to modify system data and make the system unavailable, leading to high impact on confidentiality and low impact on integrity and availability of the application.

**Other Terms**

Information Exposure, Information Leak, [CVE-2022-39013](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-39013)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The encrypted information was returned as part of a query result performed on the CMS DB.

**Solution**

This issue is fixed in the patches listed in the **Support Packages & Patches** section below.

For Business Intelligence Platform maintenance schedule and strategy, see the [Knowledge Base Article 2144559](https://me.sap.com/servicessupport/knowledge/notes/2144559).
