2480837 - Missing Authorization check in Discrete Industries and Mill Products

**Symptom**
  
**UPDATE 25th August 2020**: This note has been re-released with updated 'Correction instruction' information. We have removed the correction instruction for the software components EA-APPL and SAP_APPL and it has been moved to the note [2924859](https://me.sap.com/notes/2924859).

Discrete Industries and Mill Products (IS-A, IS-HT, IS-ADEC-MEB) do not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in escalation of privileges.

Some well-known impacts of Missing Authorization check are:
- Abuse functionality restricted to a particular user group
- Read, modify, or delete restricted data

**Other Terms**
Access control, Authorization error, Authorization profile, IS-HT-RN, IS-HT-DRM, IS-A-XLO, IS-A-JIT, IS-A-SWP, IS-ADEC-MEB

**Reason and Prerequisites**
_Pre-requisite_: The business function DIMP_SDUD is activated.

**Solution**
- The affected functions have now been enforced to properly check access restrictions.
- Please implement the correction instructions.
- For certain areas like IS-HT and IS-A (XLO and SWP), the corrections are valid only for ERP Business Suite as they have been deprecated in S/4HANA.
