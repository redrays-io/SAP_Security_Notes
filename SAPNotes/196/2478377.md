### Reason and Prerequisites

SAP Sybase products that allow DES and 3DES ciphersuites to be negotiated for TLS/SSL connections are potentially exposed to the Sweet32 Birthday Attack. DES and 3DES based ciphersuites are prioritized lower in the list of allowed ciphersuites, so SSL handshake typically settles on stronger AES-based ciphersuites. However, if your installation has customized the allowed ciphersuites list and placed DES and 3DES higher in the priority order, your installation may have a higher likelihood of exposure.

### Solution

The following server products have been modified to remove DES and 3DES ciphersuites from the default list of ciphersuites used for SSL handshake. Upgrade your installations to the product version most appropriate for your installation.

Over time, more products and product versions will be updated. Fixing server products automatically mitigates the clients from the Sweet32 vulnerability.

**NOTE:** All releases subsequent to the published fixed releases will inherit the fixes described in this security note.

By default, all products prioritize DES and 3DES based ciphersuites lower than those that use stronger AES encryption. SSL handshake typically negotiates an AES-based ciphersuite, significantly reducing exposure to the Sweet32 Birthday Attack. As an additional security measure for products that allow customization of the allowed ciphersuites, you can remove DES and 3DES based ciphersuites from the list available for SSL handshake negotiation. Refer to the following documentation for configuring allowed ciphersuites:
