### Symptom

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the SAP BI mobile application:

1. **Missing Authorization Check**
   - An untrusted input can allow an unauthorized user to modify connections from the SAP BI Mobile application.
   - **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 4.1/10
   - **Vector:** AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

2. **Password Screen Issue**
   - The application password screen does not come to the forefront when the password times out. If an alert/pop-up is displayed and the application goes to the background, returning to the foreground hides the password screen behind the alert/pop-up.
   - **CVSS Score:** 4.1

3. **Information Disclosure**
   - The reset functionality can be exploited to expose connections and configuration data.
   - **CVSS Score:** 2.4

### Solution

The issues are resolved with the MoBI 6.6 iOS client release by implementing the following:

1. The application now accepts only valid SAPBI URLs to manage connections.
2. The application password screen is always in the forefront when a password timeout occurs.
3. The password screen is displayed before the reset pop-up when a password timeout occurs.
