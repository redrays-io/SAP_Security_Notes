SAP Security Note 2471736: Switchable Authorization Checks for RFC in Accounts in SLcM

**Overview**
---
SAP Security Note **2471736** introduces new switchable authorization checks for RFC function modules within the Student Lifecycle Management (SLcM) application. These enhancements aim to strengthen system security by ensuring that remote function calls are adequately protected through refined authorization objects.

**Symptom**
---
Remote calls to RFC function modules are typically safeguarded by the `S_RFC` authorization object. However, it has been identified that `S_RFC` checks alone may not be sufficient for certain RFC function modules within SLcM, potentially compromising secure execution.

**Solution**
---
The note provides a mechanism to activate additional authorization checks via the Switchable Authorization Check Framework (SACF). These checks are initially inactive to maintain compatibility with existing processes and can be activated manually to enhance security.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Support Package Installation:**
   - Ensure that the appropriate support packages are applied. Refer to the [Support Package](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPK-2471736) section for detailed information on required support packages across different software component versions.

2. **Manual Post-Implementation Activities:**
   - After importing the note, perform the following manual steps in each system:
     - **Create Authorization Scenario:**
       - Execute transaction `SACF` in the development system.
       - Verify if the scenario definition `PIQ_ACCOUNTS_AUTH` exists.
       - If absent, download the attachment [PIQ_ACCOUNTS_AUTH.TXT](https://me.sap.com/notes/2471736/PIQ_ACCOUNTS_AUTH.TXT) and upload it via transaction `SACF_TRANSFER`.
     - **Activate Authorization Checks:**
       - Use transaction `SACF_COMPARE` post system updates to activate the necessary authorization checks.
     - **Update Table T7PIQPROCESS:**
       - Navigate to transaction `SM30`.
       - Maintain the view `V_T7PIQPROCESS` and add the following entries:
         - `ACC1` - Display Student Accounting data
         - `ACC2` - Create/Maintain Student Accounting data
         - `GRA1` - Display Student Grant Assignment data
         - `GRA2` - Create/Maintain Student Grant Assignment
     - **Create Messages in Message Class `HRPIQ00ACCOUNTING`:**
       - Go to transaction `SE91`.
       - Add the message `204: RFC error: Note 1882417 must be implemented including kernel requirements`.

3. **Authorization Scenario Details:**
   - **Scenario Name:** `PIQ_ACCOUNTS_AUTH`
   - **Affected RFC Function Modules:**
     - Example functions include `CMAC_RFC_INDIVIDUAL_FEE_CREATE`, `HRIQ_STUDENT_GRANTS_ADD`, among others listed in the [Attachments](https://me.sap.com/notes/2471736#attachments) section.
   - **Required Authorizations:** Users need `P_CM_PROC` with Activities `ACC1`, `ACC2`, `GRA1`, and `GRA2` to perform actions such as creating, maintaining, or displaying fee and grant assignment data.
