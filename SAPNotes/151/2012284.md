**Other Terms**

Virus scan, Knowledge Provider, Content Server, scanPerformed

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Both Knowledge Provider and content server are capable of performing the virus scan. To avoid scanning the same object twice, a synchronization mechanism was provided with SAP Note 1829993 and SAP Note 1820500. Under certain conditions the synchronization fails, and new objects are stored in content server without any virus scan.

**Solution**

Implement the Support Package or the attached correction instructions.
