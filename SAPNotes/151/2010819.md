SAP Security Note 2010819 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in UI_INFRA and SAP_UI

## Description

**Symptom**

UI_INFRA and SAP_UI can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **Base Score:** 4.3
- **Access Vector:** Network
- **Access Complexity:** Medium
- **Authentication:** None
- **Confidentiality Impact:** None
- **Integrity Impact:** Partial
- **Availability Impact:** None

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages within UI_INFRA and SAP_UI do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. This can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate the user.

## Solution

Apply support package **SP09** of the **SAP UI Add-On 1.0** or **SAP_UI SP09** of **SAP NetWeaver Web Application Server 7.40**.
