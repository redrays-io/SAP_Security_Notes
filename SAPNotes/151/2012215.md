### Title
**Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BI-BIP-INV**

### Description

#### Symptom
BI-BIP-INV can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**  
- **Base Score:** 4.3  
- **Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [SAP Security Notes](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

#### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, BI-BIP-INV

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages within BI-BIP-INV do not sufficiently encode INPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

#### Solution
Please install the latest version BI 3.1 FP6.4 or above to prevent any of these vulnerabilities.
