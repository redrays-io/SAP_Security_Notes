SAP Security Note 2009696 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in SHINE

**Symptom**

HANA SHINE can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages within HANA SHINE do not sufficiently encode parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Additionally, it can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

The issue has been fixed with HANA SHINE version SP07 patch 2. Please update to this version.

*Note:* HANA SHINE is demo content and is not installed in HANA by default. It is not intended to be installed in production systems.
