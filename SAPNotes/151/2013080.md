2013080 - Missing authorization check in standalone POD in Manufacturing Execution

**Symptom**

A non-authenticated user can use functions of standalone POD to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

This issue only exists when the POD is being opened via a standalone URL. After logging out of such POD by clicking the logout link the user session might sometimes stay open. The next user working on that PC will be able to open the POD under the credentials of the first user without having to log in. Clicking the logout link twice, instead of once, always closes the session.
