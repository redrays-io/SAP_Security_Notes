**Symptom**
An attacker can execute functions in SAP HANA application lifecycle manager without authentication and authorization.

**CVSS Information**
- **CVSS Base Score:** 3.5
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:N/I:P/A:N

*SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).*

**Reason and Prerequisites**
SAP HANA application lifecycle manager executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs/commands. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user.
The attacker may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this, or they may present a link to the victim.

**Solution**
The issue is fixed with version 1.0.4 of the SAP HANA application lifecycle manager (DU HANA XL_LM). This version is part of SAP HANA revision 62.

**Update Instructions:**
- Update to [HANA revision 62 or higher](https://me.sap.com/mynotes?note=2011169).
