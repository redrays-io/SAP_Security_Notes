1574333 - Directory traversal in RE-RT-SC

## Symptom
Potential directory traversal in the following components: RE-RT-SC

## Other Terms
Directory traversal, RE-RT-SC

## Reason and Prerequisites
Some of the programs specified in the correction instructions contain a vulnerability through which a malicious user can potentially write arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

## Solution
For additional information and instructions, see [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003). The corrections provided in Note 1497003 are a prerequisite for implementing this note.

### Logical File Names Used in this Solution
- IS_RE_CREATE_TAPE
- IS_RE_STATUS_COSTCOLLECTOR

### Recommendations for Setting Up Logical File Names
To avoid maintaining a high number of logical file names, some of the programs share the same logical file name. Using the same logical file name for various programs creates dependencies among these programs. To securely separate data created by different users and different programs, try to create a directory structure that reflects the user name and/or program name, and use this information when setting up the physical path and file names for the logical file paths and file names.
