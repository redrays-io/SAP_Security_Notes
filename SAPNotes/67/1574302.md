SAP Security Note 1574302: Directory Traversal Vulnerability in RE-BD and RE-RT

**SAP Security Note 1574302 - Directory traversal in RE-BD and RE-RT**

**Symptom**
RE-BD and RE-RT contain a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to potentially write arbitrary files on the remote server, which could lead to data corruption or alteration of system behavior.

**Other Terms**
- Directory traversal
- RE-BD
- RE-RT

**Reason and Prerequisites**
RE-BD and RE-RT fail to correctly validate the path to which a user-submitted file is written. This oversight allows a malicious user to potentially overwrite data in the remote system.

**Solution**
The programs addressed in the correction instructions are used in RE-BD and RE-RT (RE-Classic) for legacy data transfer. Given that RE-Classic is an older product with a successor, RE-FX (see also [SAP Note 443311](https://me.sap.com/notes/443311)), the critical coding within these programs has been removed. After applying the correction, the programs will no longer function. If you continue to use these programs, please submit a customer message under the subject areas RE-BD or RE-RT referencing this note.
