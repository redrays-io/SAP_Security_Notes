### Symptom
SAP Batch contains code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code of the userâ€™s choice. A malicious user can therefore control the behavior of the system or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without having their own legitimate credentials.

### Other Terms
- Backdoor
- Injection
- Run
- Credentials
- SAP Batch

### Reason and Prerequisites
The program code includes a functionality that allows the deletion of code, which can alter the system's behavior. A valid and authenticated user is required. Depending on the code, the user can:
- Delete data, i.e., programs
