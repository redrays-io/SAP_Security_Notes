### Description
A malicious user can discover information relating to usernames who use SAP Application Server ABAP. This information could be used to allow the malicious user to specialize their attacks against SAP Application Server ABAP.

**CVSS Information**  
CVSS Base Score: 3.5  
CVSS Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Reason and Prerequisites
Information such as the user data can be discovered using SAP Application Server ABAP. This information may be used by a malicious user to further target SAP Application Server ABAP and products built on it.

### Solution
Please apply the support package mentioned in this note at least, or the respective correction instruction.  
Note that for Releases up to 730 the default for the security change is INACTIVE and must be activated explicitly with the instance profile parameter:

```plaintext
rdisp/auth_check_user_list = TRUE
```

Otherwise, the change will behave as before. As of 731, the change is ACTIVE by default and can be DEACTIVATED if needed (not recommended) with the following setting:

```plaintext
rdisp/auth_check_user_list = FALSE
```

If the change is active, function module `TH_USER_LIST` can be executed only via RFC from a remote SYSTEM (not instance) if the authorization object `S_RZL_ADM` with ID 'ACTVT' and field '03' is granted.
