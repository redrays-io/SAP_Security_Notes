1578473 - Missing Authorization Check in Unicode Migration Tools

### Description

**SAP Note/KBA:** 1578473  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Released On:** 05.11.2014  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** Basis Components > Internationalization (I18N) (BC-I18)

#### Symptom

An authenticated user can use functions of Unicode Migration Tools to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

#### Reason and Prerequisites

Unicode Migration Tools do not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior, such as the user potentially writing arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

#### Solution

Please apply the Support Package mentioned in this note at least, or follow the respective correction instructions.  
The correction introduces authorization check **S_UMG** (UMG_ACTVT = admin) for report `UMG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOTE`.
