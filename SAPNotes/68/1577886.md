1577886 - Update #2 to security note 1534608

**Title:** Update #2 to Security Note 1534608

**Description:**
This update addresses an issue with creating the authorization object `J_IAC_PP` using transaction SU21. When following the manual advance correction from security note 1534608, users encounter the error message:

```
01 140: "The name & does not conform with the standard. Select another name."
```

**Symptom:**
Attempting to create the authorization object `J_IAC_PP` in SAP_BASIS Release 7.00 (Support Package 23 or higher) results in an error due to non-conformance with naming standards.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**
This issue occurs in customer systems running SAP_BASIS Release 7.00 with Support Package 23 or higher. Manual creation of the authorization object without the necessary transport can lead to the observed error.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, perform the following steps:

1. **Import the Transport:**
   - Download the transport file [`SUSO_J_IAC_PP_Transport.zip`](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012003146900000123802011&iv_version=0001&iv_guid=F56BFD169CF57540845F01070EBA50E1).
   - Unpack the ZIP file and place the contents in the relevant transport directory of your SAP system.
   - Import the transport to implement the authorization object `J_IAC_PP`.

2. **Implement Security Note 1534608:**
   - After importing the transport, proceed to implement security note 1534608 as per your standard procedure.
   - Ensure that the transport is also applied to all systems where you transport the SNOTE correction.
