1578067 - Hard-coded credentials in CA-GTF-RCM

**Symptom**

CA-GTF-RCM contains code which changes the program's behaviour when a user successfully authenticates with a certain username.  
A malicious user can authenticate to CA-GTF-RCM without legitimate own credentials or potentially escalate privileges.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The program code contains a hard-coded username which changes the system's behaviour should a user authenticate successfully. The user may obtain additional information which should not be displayed.  
The vulnerability is caused by a hard-coded username-password combination in the program's source code. A malicious user who specifies these credentials can log into the system without having been assigned legitimate access by the system administrator(s). In case a user already has privileges to log in with, an Escalation of Privileges may be possible if the hard-coded account has higher access rights than the original user.
