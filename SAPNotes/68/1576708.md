**Title**
1576708 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in EWS

**Symptom**
EWS can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
- XSS
- Stored cross-site scripting
- EWS

**Reason and Prerequisites**
A specific EWS operation results in a stored cross-site scripting issue. This vulnerability can be exploited to permanently modify displayed content, enabling malicious users to embed content that is rendered automatically without targeting victims individually. Additionally, stored cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**
The fix is included in **EWS 1.1 SP0**.
