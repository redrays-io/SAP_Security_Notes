**SAP Security Note 1846945**

- **Number:** 1846945
- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Version:** 3
- **Language:** English
- **Category:** Program error
- **Priority:** Correction with high priority
- **Status:** Released for Customer
- **Released On:** 12.11.2013
- **Component:** Enterprise Performance Management > Business Planning and Consolidation > NetWeaver Version

### Symptom

An authenticated user can use functions of BPC Web and Web Administration to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

### CVSS Information

**CVSS Base Score:** 6.5  
**CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Reason and Prerequisites

BPC Web and BPC Web Administration do not contain authorization checks for checking an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

However, core functions of BPC Web like Live Reporting, BPF, and System Reports are not vulnerable.
