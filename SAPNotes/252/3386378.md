**Description**

### Symptom

Under certain conditions the Microsoft Edge browser extension (*SAP GUI connector for Microsoft Edge*) allows an attacker to access highly sensitive information which would otherwise be restricted, causing a high impact on confidentiality.

### Other Terms

Information Exposure, Information Leak, headers, [CVE-2024-22125](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22125)

### Solution

More conditions are added to ensure that the headers are added to only specific request URLs and header cleaning code is refined.

Download and install version 3.0 "SAP GUI connector for Microsoft Edge" from the [Microsoft Addon Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/sap-gui-connector-for-mic/mhpigfckgphoiifbehgajfbkocihbaho). Current versions of Microsoft Edge (118.x, 119.x) will update the extension automatically when Edge is started and the Microsoft Edge Extension store is reachable.

**Please note:** To consume the correction, it is fully sufficient to install version 3.0 of the Microsoft Edge Extension "SAP GUI connector for Microsoft Edge". You **do NOT** need to install a specific SAP GUI for Windows 8.00 patch level.

**Workaround**

Please assess the workaround applicability for your SAP landscape prior to implementation.  
Note that this workaround is a temporary fix and is not a permanent solution. SAP strongly recommends applying the corrections outlined in the security note, which can be done in lieu of the workaround or after the workaround is implemented.

The extension by default uses the settings:

**Site access** - Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites you visit: **On all sites**.

As a workaround in the settings of this browser extension, you can restrict the "Site Access" setting to "On specific sites" only. This requires the end user to create an allowlist containing only the domains that shall be used for out-of-the-box SSO from SAP GUI for Windows into Microsoft Edge.
