SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP allows an unauthenticated attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted and confidential.

## Other Terms

- Information Exposure
- Information Leak
- Information Disclosure
- [CVE-2023-49580](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49580)

## Reason and Prerequisites

The vulnerability originates from a feature developed for SAP GUI for HTML, which is now reused for SAP GUI for Windows and SAP GUI for Java. The vulnerable ABAP code belongs to SAP GUI for HTML; however, the required correction had to be performed in this ABAP code as well. The attack cannot be exploited in SAP GUI for HTML but can be exploited using SAP GUI for Windows and SAP GUI for Java.

## Solution

Please implement the ABAP correction attached to this SAP Note. This ensures that a proper check for the authentication of the user is in place, preventing SAP GUI for Windows and SAP GUI for Java from disclosing information to unauthenticated attackers.
