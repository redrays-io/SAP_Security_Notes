---

**SAP Note Number**: 1656658  
**Type**: SAP Security Note  
**Priority**: Correction with high priority  
**Status**: Released for Customer  
**Released On**: 08.05.2012  

**Component**: Basis Components > ABAP Workbench, Java IDE and Infrastructure > Web Dynpro > Web Dynpro Tools - ABAP  

### Description

#### Symptom
Design time for Web Dynpro ABAP can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS,  
Design time for Web Dynpro ABAP

#### Reason and Prerequisites
Pages under design within the Design time for Web Dynpro ABAP do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.  
Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.  
If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

#### Solution
Restrict the developer permissions to as few users as possible, or implement the provided correction.  
To implement the correction, apply the support package mentioned in this note at least or follow the correction instructions provided.
