**SAP Security Note 1658926**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.05.2012  
**Component:** Customer Relationship Management > Basic Functions > Content Management (CRM-BF-COM)  

### Description

#### Symptom
CRM Content Management can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, CRM Content Management, CM

#### Reason and Prerequisites
CRM_BSP_LIBRARY_CRM within CRM Content Management does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution
Implement the correction in this note.
