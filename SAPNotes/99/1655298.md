**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program Error

**Component:** BC-FES-GUI (Basis Components > Frontend Services (SAP Note 1322184) > SAP GUI for Windows)

### Description

**Symptom:**

Risk assessment:
Using the methods `GUI_DOWNLOAD` and `EXECUTE` of the class `CL_GUI_FRONTEND_SERVICES` to display documents requires unnecessarily high privileges to call the `EXECUTE` method.

**Risk Mitigation:**

SAP has provided a patch introducing a new method `SHOW_DOCUMENT`, which wraps the download and execution steps and performs additional checks to ensure that the supplied data represents a valid document and not unauthorized code.

**Additional Implementation Efforts:**

All custom applications that utilize `GUI_DOWNLOAD` and `EXECUTE` to show documents to the user need to be modified to use `SHOW_DOCUMENT`. This will ensure that the application can be executed even with low privileges.

**Solution:**

The solution is provided by SAP in a patch. `SHOW_DOCUMENT` has been implemented for SAP release 7.40.
