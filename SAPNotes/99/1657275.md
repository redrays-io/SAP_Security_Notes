SAP Security Note 1657275 - Missing Authorization Check in FI-FM

**Symptom**
An authenticated user can use functions of FI-FM to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
FI-FM does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**
The correction is delivered in a Support Package. You have two options:

1. **Delete the view U_12424** if you agree to modify a dictionary repository object from SAP.
2. **Assign a table authorization group** to the view U_12424 that is not authorized to anyone to prevent data from being accessed using transaction SE16 or similar.

   - Use transaction **SE54** (or **SM30** for view **V_DDAT_54**) to assign the table authorization group **SPWD**.
   - Ensure that no authorizations are provided for the authorization object **S_TABU_DIS** to any users or roles. You can use transaction **SUIM** to search for users or roles with authorizations for authorization object **S_TABU_DIS**.
