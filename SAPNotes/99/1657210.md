1657210 - Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in Web.Req. Toolbox

**SAP Security Note 1657210** addresses a critical security vulnerability in the CRM Web Request toolbox that allows unauthorized users to modify displayed application content and potentially steal authentication information from legitimate users. This vulnerability is categorized under Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and affects various components within the CRM system.

### Symptom
The CRM Web Request toolbox components can be exploited by malicious users to alter displayed content without authorization. This may lead to the theft of authentication information from other users, enabling impersonation and unauthorized access with the same privileges as the targeted user. If an administrator's credentials are compromised, the entire application's security could be severely undermined.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The vulnerability stems from insufficient encoding of output parameters within the CRM Web Request toolbox components. Specifically, the lack of proper encoding allows XSS attacks, which can be leveraged to steal session data and authentication details. This issue affects multiple versions of the CRM components, making it imperative to address promptly to prevent potential exploitation.

### Solution
To mitigate this vulnerability, SAP recommends applying **Security Note 1657210** or importing the necessary changes through the relevant support package. The primary fix involves updating the HTMLB-design for the `CRM_TBOX_UPLOAD` application from CLASSIC or DESIGN2002 to DESIGN2003. This change ensures better compatibility and security without impacting the application's functionality.
