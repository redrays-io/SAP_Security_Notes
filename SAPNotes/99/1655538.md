SAP Security Note 1655538 - Unauthorized Modification in ITS-Service

## Symptom

ITS Services (TS_WS01200170H, WS01000060) can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

## Other Terms

- Cross-site scripting (XSS)

## Reason and Prerequisites

ITS Services (TS_WS01200170H, WS01000060) do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a cross-site scripting issue.

Cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.

If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

## Solution

The corrections in this note are only for security enhancement and do not change any current functionality.

The corrections of this note do only have a protecting effect if the corrections of [Note 1621946](https://me.sap.com/notes/1621946) and [Note 1488500](https://me.sap.com/notes/1488500) are implemented.

If you need the security enhancement, you may apply the changes via the relevant support package or follow the manual steps below:

1. Login to the system and go to **Maintain Services** (use the `sicf` transaction code).
2. Input the service name `TS_WS01200170H` and execute the program.
3. Double-click the `TS_WS01200170H` service on the list.
4. Change the `TS_WS01200170H` service and click the **GUI Configuration** button.
5. Add the two parameters as follows if they do not exist:

   | Parameter Name      | Value |
   |---------------------|-------|
   | ~auto_html_escaping | 1     |
   | ~new_xss_functions  | 1     |

6. Repeat the same correction for the `WS01000060` service.
