### Description

#### Symptom
BSP application CRM_IC can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, CRM_IC

#### Reason and Prerequisites
The pages `ScriptLeadV_A.htm`, `MktCampaignDetails.htm`, `ScratchPadView.htm`, `F4HelpCategory.htm`, `ScratchPadView.htm` within BSP application CRM_IC do not sufficiently encode incode and/or output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site. Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

#### Solution
