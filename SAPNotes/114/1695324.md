1695324 - Unauthorized Modification of Displayed Content in CRM-IC-SCR

**SAP Security Note 1695324** addresses a critical vulnerability in CRM-IC-SCR that allows unauthorized modification of displayed application content and potential theft of user authentication information through reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

### Symptom
An attacker can exploit the CRM-IC-SCR by modifying displayed content without authorization and potentially obtaining authentication information from legitimate users.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The API interface within CRM-IC-SCR does not sufficiently encode input parameters, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability. This allows attackers to deface or modify website content temporarily and steal authentication data, enabling user impersonation and compromising application security.

### Solution
To mitigate this vulnerability, follow these steps to update the applet:

1. **Load the Updated Applet:**
   - Download the `ISE50_JDK5.jar` file from the [attachment](https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012003146900000032232012&iv_version=0002&iv_guid=23052EC53E4D164BA8BDC1996098CF3E) to your local system.
   - Go to [transaction SE80](https://me.sap.com/servicessupport/knowledge) in your SAP system.
   - Select "BSP Application" from the Repository Browser dropdown and press Enter.
   - Navigate to `CRM_IC_ISE -> MIMEs -> editor`.
   - Right-click on the "editor" folder and select "Import MIME objects."
   - Locate and select the downloaded `ISE50_JDK5.jar` file.
   - Enter the name and description as `ISE50_JDK5.jar`.
   - Save the changes.

2. **Clear Java Cache:**
   - Close all Internet Explorer windows.
   - Go to the Control Panel -> Programs -> Java -> General Tab.
   - Click on "Settings" under Temporary Internet Files and select "Delete Files."

After performing these steps, the `ise.jsp` file will be removed from the Interactive Scripting Applet, ensuring it is no longer accessible at `\\images\\ise.jsp`.
