1697723 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CCMP_RABOX

**SAP Security Note 1697723 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CCMP_RABOX**

**Symptom**
Internet service CCMP_RABOX can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, CCMP_RABOX

**Reason and Prerequisites**
HTML Templates within Internet Service CCMP_RABOX do not sufficiently encode OUTPUT parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**
Perform the manual activities detailed in the Manual Pre-Implementation section of this Note and then apply the attached correction instructions to resolve the issue. Alternatively, upgrade to the support package outlined in this Note.
