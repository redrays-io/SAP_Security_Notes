1694952 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in CRM-MKT

**Description**

### Symptom
CRM-MKT-ISM, CRM-ISE, CRM-MD-PCT, CRM-ISA, CRM-ANA-PS, and CRM-MD-PRO can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms
Stored cross-site scripting, XSS, CRM-MKT-ISM, CRM-ISE, CRM-MD-PCT, CRM-ISA, CRM-ANA-PS, CRM-MD-PRO

### Reason and Prerequisites
CRM-MKT-ISM, CRM-ISE, CRM-MD-PCT, CRM-ISA, CRM-ANA-PS, and CRM-MD-PRO result in a stored cross-site scripting issue.

- It can be used to permanently modify displayed content from a website, allowing the attacker to embed content that is rendered automatically without the attacker having to target victims individually.
- Stored cross-site scripting can also be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session.
- An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.
- If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.
