1699074 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in CRM_IT_DEALER

**Title:** Unauthorized modification of stored content in CRM_IT_DEALER

**Symptom**
Application `CRM_IT_DEALER` can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The BSP Application `CRM_IT_DEALER` results in a stored cross-site scripting issue. It allows attackers to permanently modify displayed content from a website, embedding content that is rendered automatically without targeting victims individually. Additionally, stored XSS can be used to steal another user's authentication information, enabling impersonation and access to all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the application's security may be fully compromised.

**Solution**
Delete the BSP Application `CRM_IT_DEALER` using transaction SE80. This application was never released for customer usage and can be safely removed.
