### **Description**

SCM BAPIs do not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in escalation of privileges.

**Symptom:**
- Abuse functionality restricted to a particular user group
- Read, modify, or delete restricted data

**Other Terms:**
Access control, Authorization error, Authorization profile

### **Solution**

Some SCM BAPIs lack sufficient authorization checks. When master data BAPIs are executed via RFC, no authority check is active, allowing users to delete or change master data unauthorized.

**Affected BAPIs:**
- `BAPI_PHSRVAPS_SAVENODES`
- `BAPI_PRDSRVAPS_SAVEMULTI2`
- `BAPI_LOCSRVAPS_SAVEMULTI2`
- `BAPI_PPMSRVAPS_SAVEMULTI_30A`
- `BAPI_RSSRVAPS_SAVEMULTI_30A`
- `BAPI_RSSRVAPS_SAVEDEFS`
- `BAPI_RSSRVAPS_BLOCK_SAVEMULTI`
- `BAPI_LPHSRVAPS_SAVENODES`
- `BAPI_RSSRVSCMB_SAVEMULTI2`
- `BAPI_RSSRVSCMB_SAVEMULTI`

**Actions Required:**
- Implement the attached [correction instructions](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0002655294/425) or install the corresponding [support package](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPK-10105INS4CORE).
- For external RFC calls, authorization checks will be enforced automatically.
- For internal function module calls, authorization checks can be enabled by appending a row to table `EXTENSION_IN`:
  - **STRUCTURE:** `CHECK_AUTHORIZATION`
  - **FIELDVALUE1:** `X`

### **CVSS Information**
