1502781 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BSP

**Description**

Insufficient HTML escaping could be used by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Symptom**

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to insufficient encoding of parameters within the ICM. This allows a malicious user to modify displayed content, potentially stealing authentication information and impersonating users, which can lead to full security compromise if an administrator is impersonated.

**Solution**

Apply the relevant kernel patch indicated in this SAP Note for your release version to correct the security issue.
