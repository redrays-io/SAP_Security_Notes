**Title**
1510356 - Unauthorized usage of application functionality of ISR (ITS)

**Description**

### Symptom
A malicious user can trigger ISR Forms based on ITS without authentication and authorization.

### Other Terms
Internal Service Request, Cross-Site Request Forgery, XSRF

### Reason and Prerequisites
ISR executes certain functions through referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the user.  
If present, the attacker may use a Cross Site Scripting attack to trigger the exploit, or use an approach in which a link to click is presented to the victim.

### Solution
1. See [Note 1481392](https://me.sap.com/notes/1481392) for additional information and instructions. The correction instructions contained in Note 1481392 must be implemented before you implement this note.
2. Implement the correction instructions and create the reports `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_ISR` and `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_ISR_EA_APPL` as a local object in your system.
3. Execute the reports `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_ISR` and `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_ISR_EA_APPL` and enter a relevant transport request when prompted. The report inserts some service parameters for the adjusted ITS services (these are usually entered by choosing the button for the GUI settings in transaction SICF for maintaining ITS services).
