### Symptom
1. An authenticated user can use functionality of PLM-CFO to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an escalation of privileges.
2. A malicious user can discover information relating to user information in PLM-CFO. This information could be used to allow the malicious user to specialize their attacks against user information and PLM-CFO.

### Other Terms
Information disclosure, PLM-CFO, cFolder, Authorization, Authorization check

### Reason and Prerequisites
1. PLM-CFO lacks permission checks for an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functionality. This may result in undesired system behavior.
2. There are test pages on the PLM-CFO which are not needed for productive use. Test pages can contain debug code or code which was only used for testing purposes without a concern for security. Often these pages are no longer maintained, so errors will not get fixed.

### Solution
For **Symptom 1**: Please apply the correction instructions provided in the note.

For **Symptom 2**: Follow the given manual instructions.

**Prerequisite Notes:**
- Note **1466863** for cFolder releases **3.1, 4.0, and 4.5**.
- Note **1496707** for cFolder release **5.0**.
