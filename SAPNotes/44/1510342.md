1510342 - Code injection vulnerability in package STU2

## Symptom

Package STU2 contains code which allows execution of arbitrary program code of the userâ€™s choice. A malicious user can control system behavior or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without legitimate credentials.

## Other Terms

Backdoor, injection, run, credentials, STU2

## Reason and Prerequisites

The program code allows defining and executing user-supplied code, altering system behavior. A valid and authenticated user is required, along with one or more authorizations for Authorization object S_DB2_ADM. Depending on the code, the user can inject and run their own code, access additional information, modify or delete data, alter system output, create new users with higher privileges, or perform denial of service attacks.
