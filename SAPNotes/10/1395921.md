SAP Security Note 1395921 - Hard coded user name in CA-GTF-RCM

**Description**

CA-GTF-RCM contains the program `RMPS_IMPORT_FILEPLAN`, which includes code intended only for development purposes. This code should have been removed before the application's delivery.

**Symptom**

The program contains a hard-coded username-password combination that alters the system's behavior upon successful authentication. A malicious user who knows these credentials can:

- Log into the system without legitimate access.
- Access additional information that should remain hidden.
- Potentially escalate privileges if the hard-coded account has higher access rights than their own.

**Impact**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Malicious users can gain access without proper authorization.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information may be exposed unintentionally.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Users may obtain higher access levels, compromising system security.

**Solution**

Remove the hard-coded username and password from the application logic to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system integrity.
