SAP Security Note 1406435 - Missing Authorization Check in FM PRGN_INTERFACE_USER

**Description**

*Symptom*

The function modules `SUPRN_INS_OR_DEL_PROFILE` and `PRGN_INTERFACE_USER` (intended for internal use) allow bypassing the authorization check of user management. Specifically, the module `PRGN_INTERFACE_USER` has a parameter that controls the necessity of the authorization check. If this parameter is not set, authorization profiles can be added to a user without the executing user having the required authorizations. This loophole allows users to assign authorizations to themselves or others without proper permissions, which is not possible in standard SAP programs. However, in customer-specific programs or using transaction SE37 in test mode, this authorization concept can be circumvented.

*Reason and Prerequisites*

The issue arises due to a program error combined with an inadequate authorization concept.

**Solution**

Implement the attached correction instructions using SNOTE or import the relevant Support Package. You can download the correction using the following link:

**Workaround**

To mitigate the risk before applying the correction:

1. Restrict the authorization to use transaction SE37 in test mode, especially in productive environments.
2. Ensure that users do not have authorization to test or execute the function modules `SUPRN` or `PRGN_USERPROF` using the authorization object `S_DEVELOP`.
3. Use transaction SUIM to identify users and profiles with the following authorizations:
   - Authorization object `S_DEVELOP`
   - Activity `16`
   - Object type `FUGR`
   - Object names `SUPRN` or `PRGN_USERPROF`
4. Remove these authorizations to eliminate the risk of unauthorized profile assignments.
