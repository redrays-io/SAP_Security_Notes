1386926 - Security issue in an expert application for XI support

**SAP Note:** [1386926 - Security issue in an expert application for XI support](https://me.sap.com/support/notes/0001386926)  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Release Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 22.02.2010  
**Component:** Basis Components > NetWeaver Process Integration (PI) > Integration Server > Runtime Workbench / Monitoring

### Symptom
A user can perform administrative actions in an expert application used for XI product support without having modification rights. Currently, having display rights is sufficient. This application allows users to view logs from the Message Archiving and logs from the data aggregation job of the Message Overview. It is intended solely for use by support experts, not by customers.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The application does not perform specific checks for modification rights. However, it does check for display rights.

### Solution
The code has been enhanced to include additional security checks, ensuring that only users with modify rights can access these functionalities. The correction is included in the following (and newer) Support Packages:

- **XI 7.0 SP21**
- **XI 7.01 SP06**
- **XI 7.02 SP02**
- **PI 7.10 SP10**
- **PI 7.11 SP05**

*Older XI releases (XI 3.0) do not contain this functionality and are not affected.*
