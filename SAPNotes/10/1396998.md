**Title:** Log Viewer Server ports should be protected by firewall

**Description:**

### Symptom
The Log Viewer Server prints a warning that it is not protected by authorization checks; this allows logs to be monitored or spied. We strongly recommend that you configure your firewall to allow connections on port **1099** and **26000** only, from a dedicated SMD host or administrative systems.

### Other Terms
Log Viewer, Standalone Log Viewer Server, Log Viewer Daemon, Log Viewer Windows Service, firewall, router, security

### Reason and Prerequisites
Access to ports **1099** (default port for JNDI) and **26000** (default port for Log Viewer NI connection) is not protected by authorization checks. This allows logs to be monitored by any Log Viewer client. Whenever access to log files is perceived as a security threat, it is strongly recommended to restrict connections to the Log Viewer Server based on firewall rules or routing configuration.

**Port numbers** are configurable in:
```
<j2ee>/admin/logviewer-standalone/server/LogViewerServer.properties
```
by modifying the values of the keys:
- `Logviewer_java.naming.provider.url`
- `Logviewer_NI_port`

### Solution
Configure your firewall to allow connections on the ports mentioned above only from a dedicated SMD host or administrative systems.
