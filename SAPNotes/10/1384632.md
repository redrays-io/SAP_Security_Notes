SU01: SAP GUI input history saves passwords (SAP Note 1384632)

**SAP Note 1384632 - SU01: SAP GUI input history saves passwords**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 09.02.2010  
**Component:** Basis Components > Security - Read KBA 2985997 for subcomponents > User Administration > Users and Authorization administration

### Symptom
When using transaction SU01 to generate a new initial password for a user, the password is displayed as plaintext in the password field and saved in the input history of SAP GUI. This poses a security risk.

### Reason
This issue is caused by a program error.

### Solution
- Use the **SAP Note Assistant** to implement the correction instructions.
- Alternatively, import the relevant **Support Package**.
- For Basis Release 7.10 or higher, implement [Note 1365205](https://me.sap.com/notes/1365205).

**Explanation:**  
After applying the solution, the system will display the password only in a dialog box message or, in 7.10 or higher, in a log message. The password will no longer be displayed in the password field.
