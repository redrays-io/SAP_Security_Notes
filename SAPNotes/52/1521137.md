1521137 - Data security for JCo traces and debugging

**Description**
  
RFC-enabled function modules can contain sensitive data. During trace analysis in the SAP Java Connector (JCo) trace or in the default trace of the NetWeaver Java application server, or during the debugging of a remote-enabled function module, it may be possible to read this data in plaintext.

**Symptom**

RFC-enabled function modules may expose sensitive data such as passwords or credit card numbers in plaintext within traces or during debugging sessions. This exposure can occur in JCo traces, NetWeaver Java application server default traces, or when debugging remote-enabled function modules.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Many RFC-enabled function modules contain security-relevant data. In the user management of the NetWeaver Java application server, especially when using an ABAP system as user storage, function modules like `SUSR_CHECK_LOGON_DATA` can expose sensitive information. If trace files are created for JCo or if the relevant source code is debugged, sensitive data may be readable in plain text because it is not encrypted in these tools.

**Solution**

1. **Restrict Authorizations:**
   - Grant authorizations for trace activation, trace display, and debugging only to trusted personnel.
   
2. **Configure Trace Levels:**
   - **JCo Traces:** Use trace level 5 at most to prevent recording of critical security data.
   - **CPIC Traces:** Use trace level 2 at most to avoid capturing security-critical information.
   
3. **NetWeaver Java Application Server Logging:**
   - Set the logging level below debug for `com.sap.conn.jco` and `com.sap.mw.jco` to prevent logging of sensitive data.
   
4. **RFC Traces:**
   - Note that RFC traces do not support setting a trace level. Ensure that only trustworthy individuals have access to RFC trace files if they contain security-relevant data.
   
5. **Debugging Access:**
   - Limit debugging access and authorization for the LogViewer on the NetWeaver Java application server to trusted personnel only.
