SAP Security Note 1706527 - Unauthorized Use of Application Functions in BW-BCT-PLA-MCB

**Description**

SAP Security Note 1706527 addresses a critical vulnerability in the `BW-BCT-PLA-MCB` component of SAP Business Warehouse. A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability to execute application functions without proper authentication and authorization. This can lead to unauthorized modification of application content and potential theft of authentication information from legitimate users through Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Impact**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can execute functions with the privileges of authenticated users.
- **Data Integrity Risks:** Malicious modifications to displayed application content.
- **Credential Theft:** Potential theft of user authentication information, allowing impersonation of users, including administrators.

**Affected Components**

- **Software Component:** BI_CONT
- **Affected Versions:** 705, 706, 707, 735, 736, 746

**Solution**

To mitigate the vulnerabilities outlined in this security note, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Notes:**
   - Apply SAP Notes [1694226](https://me.sap.com/notes/1694226) and [1611670](https://me.sap.com/notes/1611670) to your BW system.

2. **Configure HTTPS:**
   - In the Web Interface (`SAPMCBW501`), set the property `'Use HTTPS'` to `true`. 
   - **Note:** The Web Interface is locked by SAP, so manual changes are not possible.

3. **Apply Support Packages:**
   - Upgrade to the following BI Content support packages to implement the necessary changes:
     - **Release 706:** [SAPK-70605INBICONT](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPK-70605INBICONT)
     - **Release 707:** All Support Package Levels ([SAPK-707xxINBICONT](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPK-707xxINBICONT))

4. **Upgrade Unsupported Releases:**
   - Releases 705, 735, 736, and 746 are out of maintenance and will not receive further support packages. It is strongly recommended to upgrade to **BI_CONT 706** or **BI_CONT 707** to ensure the security vulnerability is fully addressed.

5. **Additional Recommendations:**
   - Follow the guidance in SAP Note [733833](https://me.sap.com/notes/733833) (Section: "Web user interface: Modifications in the Web Interface") to create a copy of the `SAPMCBW501` Web interface using transaction `BSP_WB`.
