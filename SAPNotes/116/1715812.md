1715812 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BP-SOLBLD

**Description**

Under certain conditions, the usage of Solution Builder (BP-SOLBLD) can lead to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks.

**Symptom**

A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website. Additionally, it can be used to steal user authentication information, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate users and access information with the same privileges as the targeted user.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

An attacker exploiting reflected XSS can gain access to sensitive data such as authentication tokens. If an administrator's account is compromised, the security of the entire application may be fully compromised.

**Solution**

It is strongly recommended to use the latest available Add-On of Solution Builder (BP-SOLBLD) to address these security vulnerabilities. Before implementing, download and carefully read the Quick Guide attached to the SAP Best Practices Packages/RDS Packages. It is highly recommended not to use the Solution Builder Add-On in a productive system without thorough testing.
