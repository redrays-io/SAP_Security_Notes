Potential Information Disclosure in SAP_ABA (CA-FS-ECH) - SAP Note 1707816

**Overview**

SAP has released **SAP Note 1707816** addressing a critical security vulnerability in the **SAP_ABA** component, specifically within **CA-FS-ECH**. This vulnerability allows attackers to discover sensitive information related to the payload of postprocessing orders, potentially exposing security-relevant data such as credit card information.

**Vulnerability Details**

- **Symptom**: An attacker can access information about the payload in postprocessing orders.
- **Impact**: Exposure of sensitive data like credit card details, enabling attackers to tailor their attacks.
- **Affected Components**: 
  - Software Component: SAP_ABA
  - Release Versions: 711, 730, 731
  - Additional Affected Components: SAP_BS_FND versions 701 and 702

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability, SAP advises the following steps:

1. **Encrypt Payloads**: Store the payloads of postprocessing orders in an encrypted format within the database.
2. **Implement Support Package**: Import the specified support package from [SAP Note 1707816](https://me.sap.com/notes/1707816) to obtain the necessary documentation and updated package structure.
3. **Advance Correction (Optional)**: If planning to activate encryption in advance, implement the correction from [SAP Note 1707878](https://me.sap.com/notes/1707878) to prevent program terminations.
4. **Configure Encryption**:
   - Use transaction `SM30` to maintain the view `ECHVC_ENCRYPTION`.
   - Assign a private address book for SSF (encryption key) to the relevant business processes.
   - Define the encryption key and Personal Security Environment (PSE) using transactions `SSFA` and `STRUST`.
   - Activate encryption settings following SAP's detailed instructions in the note.

**Manual Implementation Steps**

The solution involves several manual activities, including creating and modifying data elements, domains, database tables, views, and messages within the ABAP Dictionary (`SE11`). Detailed step-by-step instructions are provided within the SAP Note 1707816.
