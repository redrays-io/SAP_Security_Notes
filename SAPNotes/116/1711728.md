SAP Note 1711728: Removal of Hidden Menus and Developer Mode in ESR

**Overview**  
SAP Security Note 1711728 addresses the removal of hidden menus and the Developer mode in the Enterprise Services Repository (ESR) and Directory. These changes are implemented to prevent security violations caused by shipping undocumented features to customers.

**Details**  
- **Symptom**: Users could enable Developer mode in ESR or Directory, exposing hidden menus intended for developers within the message mapping editor.
- **Reason**: Shipping non-documented features is considered a security violation and does not adhere to best practices.
- **Solution**:  
  - Developer mode has been disabled in ESR and Directory swing clients.
  - Internal developer features, such as Debug mode, XIItem context menu, F2 Feature, Error log details, and Import/Export options for Mappings, are now inaccessible.
  - Various menu options and commands that were previously available to developers are now disabled to enhance security.

**Affected Software Components**  
- **SAP_XIESR**: Versions 7.10 to 7.31  
- **SAP_XITOOL**: Versions 7.00 to 7.31  
- **SAP_XIGUILIB**: Versions 7.20 to 7.31
