1715734 - Missing authorization check in dbpool administration

## Description

### Symptom
An authenticated user can use functions of dbpool to which access should be restricted. This may result in an escalation of privileges.

*Update 14th May 2019*: This note contains a partial fix. Please implement [Note 2664504](https://me.sap.com/notes/0002664504) for a complete fix. If you have not implemented this note, then implement only 2664504. Additionally, CVSS information is also made available.

### Reason and Prerequisites
dbpool does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access certain functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.
