**Reason and Prerequisites**

Prerequisite: You are using the authorization object S_DEVELOP with restrictions on packages, in particular for activity "Create" (01).

**Solution**

By the correction, the check on S_DEVELOP with restrictions on packages is strengthened. This may lead to the fact that create rights for some developers are not granted anymore. Hence, authorization S_DEVELOP for developers shall be reviewed.

Implement the correction with SNOTE or install the corresponding Support Package.
