3152442 - [CVE-2022-27669] Missing Authentication Check in XML Data Archiving Service

**Symptom**
An unauthenticated user can exploit functions of the XML Data Archiving Service in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for Java, which should be restricted. This vulnerability could lead to privilege escalation.

**CVE Details**
- **CVE Identifier:** [CVE-2022-27669](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2022-27669)
- **CVSS Score:** 5.3 (Medium)
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The administrative pages of the old XML Data Archiving Service did not require authentication. Although these pages haven't been used since SAP NetWeaver 7.10, they were still deployed, leaving the system vulnerable.

**Affected Component**
- **Component:** XML Data Archiving Service (BC-ILM-DAS)
- **Affected Versions:** SAP NetWeaver 7.50

**Solution**
The old XML Data Archiving Service administrative pages have been permanently removed from the SAP NetWeaver 7.50 distribution to mitigate this vulnerability.
