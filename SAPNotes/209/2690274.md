### **Symptom**

S_RFC authorization checks are not sufficient to ensure the secure execution of RFC function modules covered by this SAP Note. New switchable authorization checks have been implemented for RFC function modules in SAP Central Finance - Data Flow Verification.

### **Reason and Prerequisites**

Remote calls to RFC function modules are by default protected by checks on the authorization object S_RFC. These checks must not be deactivated. Refer to [SAP Note 2216306](https://me.sap.com/notes/2216306) for recommended and deprecated settings of the profile parameter `auth/rfc_authority_check`. Authorization for S_RFC must be limited to the minimum required for all users to ensure system security. Many RFC function modules can be sufficiently protected using S_RFC authorization checks and often do not perform additional functional authorization checks. For more information on RFC Security, see the white paper "[Securing Remote Function Calls (RFC)](https://www.sap.com/documents/2015/07/e6441a8d-5b7c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html)" attached to [SAP Note 2008727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2008727).

It has been identified that S_RFC authorization checks alone are not sufficient for secure execution of certain RFC function modules. Therefore, new switchable authorization checks need to be activated, and corresponding roles should be updated if these RFC function modules are included in your system's S_RFC authorizations.

### **Solution**

New switchable authorization checks have been implemented and are delivered inactive to ensure compatibility with your current processes. These checks can be activated in transaction **SACF** as described in the attached manual correction instructions. For additional information on the switchable authorization check framework (SACF), refer to [SAP Note 1922808](https://me.sap.com/notes/1922808).

#### **Affected RFC Function Modules**

- **FIN_CFIN_DFV_CLR_MISSING_ITEM**

#### **Implementation of the Switchable Authorization Check**

The switchable authorization checks are provided via support packages and can be technically pre-implemented using correction instructions. After implementation, the checks remain inactive until manually activated.

#### **Activation Steps**

1. **Run Transaction SACF_COMPARE:** After system updates via SAP Update Manager (SUM), you will be prompted to run this transaction to activate the necessary switchable authorization checks.
2. **Manual Activation:** Follow the correction instructions provided to activate the checks tailored to your business processes.

#### **Related Scenario**

The switchable authorization check within **FIN_CFIN_DFV_CLR_MISSING_ITEM** relies on the scenario **FIN_CFIN_SOURCE**, delivered with [SAP Note 2495144](https://me.sap.com/notes/2495144).
