Missing Authorization Check in SAP Mobile Platform Native SDK, Android (SAP Note 2695776)

**Description**

**Symptom**
There are Improper Access Control (CWE-284), Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication (CWE-927), and Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel (CWE-940) vulnerability issues in the SMP Native SDK Android Federation library if application developers do not protect their apps with their own signing permissions.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
By default, the necessary permission was not defined in the Federation library. However, application developers can define their own permission to protect the Federation libraryâ€™s data using the Android manifest merging mechanism. If this permission is not defined by the application developer, the application becomes vulnerable. Additionally, the user must install a third-party application that exploits the vulnerability.

**Solution**
The Federation library now includes a default signature permission, ensuring that by default, only applications signed with the same developer signing key can communicate with each other, preventing other third-party applications from accessing the data. When implementing this security note, application developers should be aware of the following options:

1. **Use the new Federation library as is (including the default signing permission):** All applications must be rebuilt with this permission by including the new Federation library in each application.
2. **Overwrite the default permission:** Continue using the existing permission by overriding the default permission.

**Affected Components**
- **Software Component:** SMP_NATIVE_SDK
- **Version:** 3.1

**CVSS Score**
- **Score:** 7.4 (High)
- **Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Recommended Actions**
- Apply the security note to update the Federation library.
- Rebuild applications with the new signing permission or overwrite the default permission as per your application's requirements.
- Ensure that all systems into which you transport the Note are updated accordingly.
