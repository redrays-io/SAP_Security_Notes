2699233 - [CVE-2018-2499] Information Disclosure in SAP Financial Consolidation Cube Designer

### Symptom
A security weakness in Cube Designer may allow an attacker to discover the password hash of an admin user.

**Impact:**
- Loss of information and system configuration confidentiality
- Information gathering for further exploits and attacks

### Reason and Prerequisites
Manipulation of certain Deployer Web Service calls to the Financial Consolidation system can lead to unauthorized access to admin password hashes.

### Solution
The fix involves a change in the configuration file of the Deployer Service. A whitelist of Financial Consolidation URLs must be configured by a Cube Designer administrator. This whitelist will prevent unauthorized manipulation of service calls. 

**Steps:**
1. Ensure there is at least one uncommented entry in the configuration file to activate the whitelist check.
2. Once URLs are listed, any web service calls not included in the whitelist will cause the application to display an error message:
   > "The URL youâ€™re trying to connect to is not part of the URLs provided in the Cube Deployer configuration file. Please contact your administrator."
3. This applies to web services using both HTTP and HTTPS.
