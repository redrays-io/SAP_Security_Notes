1595373 - Unauthorized use of application functions in CRM-IC-SEA

**Symptom**

A malicious user can execute functions in CRM-IC-SEA without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**

Cross-site request forgery, XSRF, CRM-IC-SEA

**Reason and Prerequisites**

CRM-IC-SEA executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. The malicious user may use a cross-site scripting attack to achieve this, or they may present a link to the victim.
