Security Note 1596039: Deactivate Obsolete BSP Applications to Prevent XSS Vulnerabilities

**SAP Security Note 1596039** addresses critical vulnerabilities related to obsolete BSP (Business Server Pages) applications in the complaints processing area of the agency business module. These outdated applications can lead to functional errors and security breaches, including cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Symptom
The BSP applications listed below are obsolete and may result in unintended functional behaviors:
- LO_AB_CLAIMS
- LO_AB_LISTE
- LO_AB_MASTERDAT
- LO_AB_MENU
- LO_AB_REPORT
- LO_AB_USER_MGMT
- LO_AB_VND_CLAIM
- LO_AB_VND_LISTE

Additionally, these applications are susceptible to unauthorized modifications, potentially allowing attackers to persistently alter application content and access authentication information from legitimate users.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The obsolete BSP applications can be exploited by attackers to:
- Modify application content without authorization.
- Persist these modifications.
- Obtain authentication information from other users.

### Solution
To mitigate these vulnerabilities, you must deactivate the affected BSP applications by importing the relevant Support Package. Since these applications are obsolete both functionally and from a security standpoint, they should no longer be in use.

**Steps to Resolve:**
1. **Import Support Package**: Apply the necessary Support Package specific to your software component version (refer to the Support Package section below).
2. **Manual Deactivation**: If you prefer not to import the Support Package, you can manually comment out the layout and event handler source code or delete the entire BSP application.
3. **Delete Service Nodes**: Use transaction SICF to remove the service nodes associated with these BSP applications.
4. **Use New Application**: Transition to the new Web Dynpro application "Complaints Workbench for Customers" available with ECC 6.00 Enhancement Package 4. Launch it using transaction WCUSPOWL.
