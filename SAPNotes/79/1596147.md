**Title**

1596147 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in ABAP Help

**Description**

### Symptom

The Web version of the ABAP Keyword Documentation can be abused by a malicious user, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

### Other Terms

Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, ABAP Keyword Documentation

### Reason and Prerequisites

The Web version of the ABAP Keyword Documentation does not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. A malicious user who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution

The Web version of the ABAP Keyword Documentation is only available if the services `/sap/public/bc/abap/docu` and `/sap/bc/abap/docu` are enabled in transaction SICF and the issue exists only with SAP NetWeaver 7.02 SP8 and SAP NetWeaver 7.03 SP1 and 7.31 SP1.
