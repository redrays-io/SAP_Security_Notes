**SAP Security Note 1881073 - Unauthorized modification of displayed content in BSP application**

**Released On:** June 10, 2014  
**Component:** Basis Components > Client/Server Technology (BC-CST)  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer

### Description

#### Symptom

BSP applications and Internet Communication Manager can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify displayed application content without authorization, and to potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

#### Other Terms

Reflected cross-site scripting, XSS, Internet Communication Manager

#### Reason and Prerequisites

BSP applications within SAP do not sufficiently encode input parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user’s authentication information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the application may be fully compromised.

### Solution

Please apply corrections for both SAP Kernel and ABAP.

1. **SAP Kernel**

   Implement the kernel with the patch level mentioned in this note, or higher. Note that kernel 7.20 is the DCK kernel for all 7.x kernels.
