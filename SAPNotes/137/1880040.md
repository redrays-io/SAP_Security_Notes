1880040 - Potential denial of service in SQL Anywhere

**SAP Security Note 1880040 - Potential Denial of Service in SQL Anywhere**

**Symptom**

An attacker can remotely exploit SQL ANYWHERE SERVER, rendering it and the resources used to serve SQL ANYWHERE SERVER unavailable.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.3
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:N/I:N/A:C

**Other Terms**

DoS, denial of service, SQL ANYWHERE SERVER

**Reason and Prerequisites**

**Resource Exhaustion:** The issue is caused by a resource exhaustion condition. An attacker can launch a specifically crafted request that causes the process to consume excessive resources. As a result, no other processes can allocate new resources, rendering the system unavailable. This condition can be intentionally provoked by an attacker to cause a denial of service.

**Solution**

Apply the SQL Anywhere support package containing version **12.0.1 Build 3828** or greater.
