SAP Security Note 1872800: Whitelist Based Clickjacking Protection in Web Dynpro ABAP

**Symptom:**
Web Dynpro ABAP does not protect its applications against Clickjacking attacks.

**Description:**
Clickjacking is a UI-redressing attack where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different than intended. This attack leverages standard HTML capabilities without exploiting code weaknesses in the application.

**Solution:**
SAP provides a whitelist-based framework for Clickjacking protection in NetWeaver technologies, as the standard X-FRAME-OPTIONS header is not suitable for common NetWeaver integration scenarios. This framework is detailed in [SAP Note 2319727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319727). For Web Dynpro ABAP, follow the steps below to implement the necessary protections.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Update Unified Rendering:**
   - Refer to [SAP Note 2090746](https://me.sap.com/notes/2090746) for updating the Unified Rendering version of your system.

     - [SAP Note 2299529](https://me.sap.com/notes/2299529) - How to update Unified Rendering for Web Dynpro ABAP

2. **Create Message in SE91:**
   - Use transaction SE91 to create the following message in message class `WEBDYNPRO_RT`:
     - **Message Number:** 031
     - **Message Text:** ICF service for Clickjacking Framing Protection is not active.
   - Enable "Self-Explanatory" for this message.

3. **Activation of Protection:**
   - Add at least one entry into table `HTTP_WHITELIST` with `ENTRY_TYPE=30`.
