1881221 - HTTP Response Splitting in the SAP BC

**SAP Note Number:** 1881221  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 4  
**Language:** English  
**Released On:** 13.08.2013  
**Component:** Basis Components > Middleware > Business Connector

### Symptom

An HTTP response splitting vulnerability exists in the SAP Business Connector 4.8.

**CVSS Information**  
- **Base Score:** 5.0  
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N  

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Reason and Prerequisites

In rare cases, the SAP Business Connector 4.8 does not properly validate and encode input values provided by HTTP clients. As a result, an attacker may send malicious input to the Business Connector server that will be passed back to the client. This allows an attacker to take control over the HTTP response header and/or body and cause various exploits on the client side.

### Solution

The solution is rolled out with **Hotfix 3 for Core Fix 5** for the SAP Business Connector 4.8. From this patch level onward, potentially dangerous characters are always properly encoded.

**Steps to Apply the Fix:**

1. **Install Core Fix 5** for SAP Business Connector 4.8 if not already installed.
