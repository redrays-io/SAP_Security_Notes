1879601 - Secure setup of the standalone enqueue server

**Symptom**

You want to use the standalone enqueue server securely in the network.

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.8
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/AU:S/C:C/I:N/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this SAP Note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the FAQ section at [https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The standalone enqueue server is an infrastructure component of the SAP system and provides the enqueue function to the SAP system (AS ABAP or AS JAVA). For this purpose, it opens a network port to which network clients can connect.

The following clients have to be able to connect to this port:
- ABAP work processes
- Java worker nodes
- Enqueue replication server

All these clients are server components that work in the server network.

**Solution**

SAP recommends that you protect the server network with a firewall and prevent access to the standalone enqueue server from the outside. Also, see the guide for "[Secure Configuration of SAP NetWeaverÂ® Application Server Using ABAP](https://me.sap.com/docs/DOC-17149)" on SCN [http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-17149](http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-17149).

The secure operation of the standalone enqueue server without a firewall requires the configuration of access control lists (ACL). Refer to [Note 1495075](https://me.sap.com/notes/1495075).
