**SAP Security Note 1983739: Hard-coded credentials in CRM-BTX-BF-FIN**

**Description**

### Symptom

CRM-BTX-BF-FIN contains code that changes the program's behavior when a user is successfully authenticated with a certain username.

An attacker can be authenticated to CRM-BTX-BF-FIN without having their own legitimate credentials, or they may escalate privileges.

### CVSS Information

- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.0
- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note. For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Other Terms

Hard-coded, credentials, CRM-BTX-BF-FIN

### Reason and Prerequisites

The program code contains a hard-coded username that changes the system's behavior if a user is successfully authenticated. The user may obtain additional information that should not be displayed.

The vulnerability is caused by a hard-coded username and password combination in the program's source code. An attacker who specifies these credentials can log on to the system without having been assigned legitimate access by the system administrator(s). If a user already has privileges with which they can log on, an escalation of privileges may be possible if the hard-coded account has higher access rights than the original user.
