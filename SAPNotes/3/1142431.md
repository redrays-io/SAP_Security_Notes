1142431 - Security information: Buffer overflow in ODBO provider

---

**Symptom**

When using the OLE DB for OLAP provider, an access violation may occur in the dynamic link library (`MDrmSAP.dll`). This error may cause Microsoft Internet Explorer to crash. This termination can be exploited to execute other local programs with higher rights and compromise system safety.

**Solution**

- **Update DLL:**  
  The issue is corrected in versions higher than 3.7.0.3 of `MDrmSAP.dll`, which is part of the OLE DB for OLAP provider.

- **BI Frontend Installation:**  
  The OLE DB for OLAP provider is implemented on the client during the BI Frontend installation. To obtain the fix, use the [BI Frontend package BI 7.x patch 400](https://me.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1142431?language=en) or use the BI Frontend package 6 for Release BW 3.50.

- **Manual DLL Replacement:**  
  The affected DLL can also be replaced individually without updating the BI Frontend completely. The updated DLL is attached to this note in packed form. After unpacking, replace the file and execute the command `regsvr32 MDrmSAP.dll` to register the DLL.
