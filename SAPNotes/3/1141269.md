**Symptom**

There is a possible XSS vulnerability in ITS/SAP GUI for HTML that may allow unauthorized script execution.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

- **Affected Software:** SAP GUI for HTML integrated with ITS.
- **Prerequisite:** SAP GUI for HTML must be in use.

**Solution**

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can choose one of the following approaches:

1. **Update ITS:**
   - Install the latest patch level of your external ITS.

2. **Update SAP_BASIS:**
   - Import the latest Basis Support Package of your ITS integrated with NetWeaver.

3. **Apply Advanced Corrections:**
