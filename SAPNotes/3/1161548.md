SAP Security Note 1161548 - SLD API: Switching to secure storage

**Symptom**

You use transaction `SLDAPICUST` to manage HTTP destinations for the System Landscape Directory (SLD) in Web AS ABAP. Passwords entered to log on to the SLD are encrypted and access-protected; however, they are stored outside of the secure storage.

**Solution**

By importing the specified Support Package, the storage of passwords in transaction `SLDAPICUST` is adjusted to use the secure storage in ABAP, which conforms to the SAP security standard.

After importing the Support Package, the passwords remain in their current storage. By executing the change operation in transaction `SLDAPICUST`, the passwords are automatically moved to the secure storage and deleted from the previous storage. It is sufficient to switch from display mode to change mode and back.

With the imported Support Package, storage in the secure storage becomes the standard setting. You can explicitly control the behavior by manually entering commands in the 'OK code' field in transaction `SLDAPICUST`:

- **SECSTORE_OFF**: Deactivates storage in the secure storage. Passwords are then saved in the old storage again.
- **SECSTORE_ON**: Activates storage in the secure storage and restores the standard behavior.

**Important Notes:**

- All content of the secure storage becomes illegible **if the installation number is changed** and must be migrated manually. For more information, see [Note 816861](https://me.sap.com/notes/816861).
- In a newly installed system without a license (installation number "INITIAL"), the passwords of the SLD destinations are always stored outside the secure storage. Changing the installation number from "INITIAL" to a numerical value, required during licensing, **does not require a migration** of these passwords, as they are moved to secure storage only afterwards.
