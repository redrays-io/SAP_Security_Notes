### Reason and Prerequisites

### Solution
Please apply the patch which is a registry file attached with this note. 

- For **32-bit machines**, use `patch_32.reg` which is attached as [patch_32.zip](https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012006153200000044062008&iv_version=0011&iv_guid=2BA1A0F75E9FA04ABCCEC6CD3CEFC6FC).  
  Extract the file and double-click on it to make the required registry changes. This will not affect the way the ECL Viewer functions.

- For **64-bit machines**, use `patch_64.reg` which is attached as [patch_64.zip](https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/sapnotes/public/services/attachment.htm?iv_key=012006153200000044062008&iv_version=0011&iv_guid=D0B7C3FBA0DAA740B0B28939C82B3AF4).

You can also use the following options to resolve the issue:
1. Apply the kill-bit manually (Please refer to the attachment in [Note 1153794](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001153794)).
2. Set the kill-bits as described for the entire SAP GUI (Please refer to [Note 1092631](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001092631)).
3. Install the patched version of the control by updating SAP GUI (Please refer to [Note 1302717](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001302717)).

**Update as of April 15th, 2009:**  
Please note that after the vulnerability addressed by this note was published on March 31, 2009, it was discovered that the kill-bit is not sufficient to protect against all potential attacks. Only by patching the ECL Viewer with patch 2 will the system be protected from other attack vectors.  
See [SAP OSS note 1329703](https://me.sap.com/notes/0001329703) for more details about patch 2 of ECL Viewer 6.0.
