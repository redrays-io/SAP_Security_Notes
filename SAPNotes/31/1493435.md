SAP Security Note 1493435: Potential disclosure & modification of persisted data in MPN

**Description**

A malicious user can exploit the Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) by using specially crafted inputs to execute arbitrary database commands. This allows the retrieval, modification, or removal of data persisted by the system.

**Affected Releases:**
- SAP ECC 600
- SAP ECC 602
- SAP ECC 603
- SAP ECC 604
- SAP ECC 605

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The vulnerability arises from an SQL injection flaw. The application constructs SQL statements by incorporating user-controlled input without proper validation, enabling attackers to manipulate these statements to access or alter the database.

**Solution**

To address this issue, you should:
1. **Import the corresponding support package** for your SAP ECC version.
2. **Implement the attached advanced correction manually** if necessary.

**Prerequisite**

Before applying this note, ensure that **Note 1487337** is implemented.
