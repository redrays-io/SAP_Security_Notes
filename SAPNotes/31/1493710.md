1493710 - Texts in the alert inbox are not encoded

## Description

**Symptom**

The system displays the texts of alerts in the alert inbox (implemented as BSP ALRTINBOX). These texts are either maintained in Customizing or may be included when alerts are triggered. These texts are displayed without encoding.

**Other Terms**

Cross Site Scripting, XSS, ALRTINBOX

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The alert inbox displays the alert texts without encoding them in advance.

## Solution

Implement the correction instructions using the Note Assistant or import the relevant Support Package. After applying the correction, the system will encode the texts on the alert inbox page. If you need to deactivate the encoding of the texts, follow these steps:

1. Use the maintenance view (SM30) to maintain the following value in table `SXPARAMS`:

   | Parameter           | Value |
   |---------------------|-------|
   | ALERT_NO_BSP_ENCODING | X     |
