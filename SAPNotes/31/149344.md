149344 - Security gap in the Workflow Customizing

**Description:**
In the Business Workflow area, the automatic customizing process creates a user named `WF-BACKGROUND`. This user is assigned the `SAP_ALL` and `SAP_NEW` authorizations because all background steps in the workflow are executed under this user. The security issue arises because user administrators with the lesser `S_A.ADMIN` standard profile can create a 'dialog user' from the `WF-BACKGROUND` user. This indirectly grants them `SAP_ALL` authorization, potentially leading to unauthorized access and elevated privileges within the system.

**Impact:**
This vulnerability allows individuals with the `S_A.ADMIN` profile to gain full system authorizations (`SAP_ALL`) by leveraging the ability to create dialog users from the `WF-BACKGROUND` account. This can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of system integrity.

**Solutions:**
1. **Assign to SUPER User Group:**
   - Assign the `WF-BACKGROUND` user to the `SUPER` user group.
   - Ensure that administrators do not belong to the `SUPER` user group to prevent unauthorized changes to the `WF-BACKGROUND` user.

2. **Execute Source Code Correction:**
   - Apply the provided source code correction to ensure that the `WF-BACKGROUND` user is created with the `SUPER` user group from the outset.
   - This guarantees that the user does not receive excessive authorizations during the automatic customizing process.
