- **Recency:** Updated

**Symptom**
This security note addresses a vulnerability where a BW interface with portals can be exploited by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization. This could potentially allow the attacker to obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Other Terms**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The API interface within the BW portal integration does not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting issue. An attacker can use this vulnerability to deface or modify web content temporarily or steal another user's authentication information, potentially compromising the application's security.

**Solution**
1. **Deactivate SICF Internet Service:**
   - Deactivate the internet service `/default_host/sap/bw/dr` if the drag&relate feature is not used. This applies to most BW customers.
   
2. **Implement Support Package:**
   - Apply the corresponding support package provided by SAP.
   
3. **Urgent Cases:**
   - If you need to keep the drag&relate service active, implement the provided correction instructions immediately.
