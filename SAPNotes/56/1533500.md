1533500 - Argentina J1ACAE: Potential Directory Traversal

**Symptom**

Potential Directory Traversal for J_1A_CAE.

**Other Terms**

Path traversal, FI_AEI_FILE_PATH

**Reason and Prerequisites**

The program contained in the correction instructions has vulnerabilities that allow a malicious user to potentially read or write arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly disclosing, corrupting, or altering confidential information.

**Solution**

Please refer to [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from Note 1497003 are a prerequisite for the implementation of this note.

**Logical File Name Used in this Solution**

The following logical file name has been created to enable the validation of physical file names:
- **FI_J1ACAE_FILE**

**Program Using this Logical Filename**
- **J_1A_CAE**

**Parameters Used in this Context**
- `<PARAM_1>` Program name

The application J_1A_CAE is passing an additional parameter `parameter_1` (`sy-cprog`) to the Function Module `FILE_VALIDATE_NAME`. This allows a customer to insert the parameter while configuring the physical paths for the Logical File Name FI_J1ACAE_FILE.

**Logical File Path Used in this Solution**
- **FI_AEI_FILE_PATH**
