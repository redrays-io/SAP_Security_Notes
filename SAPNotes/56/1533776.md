## Description

**SAP Note Number:** 1533776  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 14.12.2010  
**Component:** Financial Accounting > General Ledger Accounting > Basic Functions > Value Added Tax (VAT)

### Symptom

Potential Directory Traversal in the following components:
- FI-GL-GL-F
- CA-JVA

Path traversal vulnerability allows a malicious user to potentially write or delete arbitrary files on the remote server, which could lead to data corruption or alteration of system behavior.

### Reason and Prerequisites

The vulnerability arises from programs containing flaws that permit unauthorized file operations. To effectively implement this note, corrections from **Note 1497003** are a prerequisite.

### Solution

Please refer to [Note 1497003](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from this note must be applied before implementing the changes from **Note 1533776**.

**Logical File Names Used in this Solution:**
- **FI_TAX**
  - Programs: RFUMSV00, RFASLD20, RGJVTAX2
- **FI_RFASLDPC**
  - Program: RFASLDPC

**Logical File Paths:** All logical file names use the logical file path `FI_ROOT`.

**Footnote:**  
Program RFASLDPC is used to copy files created by several other programs to the frontend PC. A high-level directory should be configured for RFASLDPC to ensure it cannot access unrelated files.
