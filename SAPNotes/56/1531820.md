1531820 - Update 1 to Security Note 1465129

**Description**

**Symptom**
Security Note 1465129 specifies kernel releases that are higher than 46D on the "SP Patch Level" tab page, even though the validity is limited to Releases 31I to 46D.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
Although the error is limited to Kernel Releases 31I to 46D, documentation in the kernel was adjusted in higher releases. The functions to which the documentation refers are irrelevant in higher releases.

**Solution**
Since the entries on the "SP Patch Level" tab page are not relevant for customers, they have been deleted to prevent confusion.
