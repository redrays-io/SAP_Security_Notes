SAP Security Note 1414256: Streamlining TMSADM Password Changes

---

**Symptom**
This security note addresses the complexity involved in changing the password of the user `TMSADM`. Previously, the process required numerous manual steps, making it cumbersome for administrators.

**Reason and Prerequisites**
The complexity arises due to missing functions and specific security requirements. To implement the solution provided in this note (up to Release 6.40), certain prerequisites must be met:
- **Import Support Packages** or **implement correction instructions** in all systems within the relevant landscape.
- Ensure **administration authorizations** are granted to the executing user across all systems.
- **Deactivate SNC protection** before changing the `TMSADM` password. In systems with high Quality of Protection (QoP), reduce the QoP level to allow non-secure connections temporarily.

**Solution**
Instead of relying on manual steps as described in [Note 761637](https://me.sap.com/notes/761637), this note introduces a report named `TMS_UPDATE_PWD_OF_TMSADM` that automates the password change process. The report performs the following actions:
1. **Creating Test Users and Destinations:** Sets up necessary test environments across all systems.
2. **Validating Test Users and Destinations:** Ensures that the test setup is correct before proceeding.
3. **Updating Passwords:** Changes the `TMSADM` passwords uniformly across the landscape.

**Execution Steps**
1. **Run the Report:**
   - Execute `TMS_UPDATE_PWD_OF_TMSADM` in client 000 of the domain controller.
   - Choose one of the available password options:
     - **Enter a Custom Password:** Ensure it meets compatibility and security requirements.
     - **Set Standard Password:** Uses the default password defined during the implementation of [Note 761637](https://me.sap.com/notes/761637).
     - **Reset to Original Password:** Reverts to the standard password used since Release 3.1I, useful for troubleshooting.
2. **Approve Logons:** The system will request logons in client 000 of every system in the TMS domain.
3. **Monitor Execution:** The report will display a log of all actions performed, which can be reviewed at any time.

**Known Limitations**
- The report does **not support domain links**.
- Systems must remain **unlocked** during the password change to prevent the `TMSADM` account from being locked across the landscape.

**Troubleshooting**
If systems are locked during the password change:
- **Unlock all systems** before executing the report.
- If locking occurs, change the password in the locked systems manually using the report or refer to [Note 761637](https://me.sap.com/notes/761637).

**Additional Information**
- **Support Packages:** Ensure that all relevant support packages are applied. Refer to the [Support Package section](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB1414256) for detailed information.
- **Correction Instructions:** Follow the step-by-step correction instructions provided in the [Correction Instructions section](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001414256/41).
