SAP Security Note 1414994 - sapinit permissions

**SAP Security Note 1414994 – sapinit permissions**

**Description:**

**Symptom**
The `sapinit` script is installed with permission `777` (rwxrwxrwx). This could be misused to gain root permissions.

**Other Terms**
- sapinit
- permissions
- installsapinit.sh
- SYS V

**Reason and Prerequisites**
*(Not provided)*

**Solution**
This problem was fixed in versions of the SAP Kernel successive to 11.2007. Since a correct script installation could only be done as the root user, this is automatically done only during a new SAP Installation. For upgrades to newer SAP releases, EhP Installation, or updates to newer SP versions, you have to fix this potential security issue manually.

To apply the fix, proceed as follows:

1. Download the newest version of the `sapinit` archive attached to [Note 823941](https://me.sap.com/notes/823941).
2. If you are upgrading to a higher SAP release, you should already have the newest version of the script in the location mentioned in [Note 823941](https://me.sap.com/notes/823941).
3. Extract the content of the archive in a temporary directory.
4. Change to the temporary directory.
5. As root, execute the script `installsapinit.sh`.
