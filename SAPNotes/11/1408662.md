1408662 - SAP Business One does not start after patch file application

### Symptom

Due to severe security issues with the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL), SAP Business One partners and customers may need to apply a runtime fix mentioned in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base Article:

[Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035 - Moderate Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution (969706)](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS09-035.mspx).

You might encounter one of the following situations after having applied a new SAP Business One patch file:

- **Your SAP Business One system fails to start** after you have applied a new SAP Business One patch file that you downloaded from SAP Service Marketplace.
  - If you want to find out whether you are affected by this problem, refer to the section "Detecting whether SAP will not start up due to missing MS patch" in the attached PDF document.

- **Your SAP Business One system runs fine** but you did not apply the Microsoft security fix mentioned above. However, future downloads of SAP binaries from SAP Service Marketplace might not work (depending on release, etc.).

In both cases, we strongly recommend that you apply the Microsoft ATL security patch as described below.

### Reason and Prerequisites

You run an SAP Business One installation on one of the supported Microsoft platform versions listed below and have not yet applied the MS ATL security patch:

- Windows Server 2003
- Windows Server 2003 R2
- Windows Server 2008

- Windows SBS 2003
- Windows SBS 2003 R2
