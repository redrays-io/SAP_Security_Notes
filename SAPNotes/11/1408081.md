SAP Security Note 1408081 - Basic settings for reg_info and sec_info

**SAP Note/KBA:** 1408081  
**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 22  
**Released On:** May 14, 2019  
**Component:** BC-CST-GW (Basis Components > Client/Server Technology > Gateway/CPIC)

### Description
Since the SAP Gateway is an interface of the application server to external items (other SAP systems, external programs, etc.), it is crucial to fulfill security criteria to protect the entire SAP system. The security of the SAP Gateway is managed via the `reg_info` and `sec_info` files, defined by the instance profile parameters `gw/reg_info` and `gw/sec_info`.

**Key Points:**
- **Updates:**
  - **May 14, 2019:** All sections of text in this SAP Note and its validity have been revised. CVSS information has been provided.
  - **November 3, 2010:** Refer to security note 1525125 for details.
- **Security Configuration:**
  - **reg_info and sec_info:** These files control the registration and execution of external programs. Proper configuration enhances system security while maintaining minimal maintenance effort.
  - **Keywords:**
    - **"local":** Available in SAP Kernel Releases 46D and 640.
    - **"internal":** Available starting from SAP Kernel Release 720.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Place `reg_info` and `sec_info` in a shared directory for maintainability.
  - Ensure profile parameter `gw/reg_no_conn_info` is active to prevent bypassing `sec_info` and `reg_info`.
  - Use encryption for communications outside the DMZ using SAProuter.
