**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 2  
**Released On:** April 23, 2012  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** Occasional Platform User > Duet > Duet Platform

### Description

#### Symptom
ABAP functions to be executed are determined at runtime based on input. Specifically, the function name to be executed at runtime can be passed as an input parameter.

#### Other Terms
- Generic ABAP function call
- Dynamically called functions
- Dynamically called methods
- Functions name as input
- IW
- Workflow Pattern

#### Reason and Prerequisites
ABAP functions executed at runtime based on input may lead to the following issues:
- Crash of the SAP application server
- Disruption of business logic, resulting in inconsistent data states
- Manipulation of business logic, resulting in unprivileged access to restricted functionality

#### Solution
Ensure that dynamically called functions are not determined by user input. Code changes have been implemented so that the functions passed as input are not executed. Apply the correction instructions in this note using transaction `/nsnote`.
