1412864 - Redirection of Web site in Xcelsius may be incorrect

```markdown
### Symptom
This SAP Note has already been released as a normal SAP Note that is not a Security Note. No further activities are required if you have already implemented this SAP Note.

Xcelsius Dashboards can be used for phishing attacks by allowing an attacker to publish a URL purporting to be from the product, which redirects the victim to a URL chosen by the attacker. This enables an attacker to falsely gain the trust of a victim and elicit private data from them (such as authentication information).

**CVSS Information**

- **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3
- **CVSS Base Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this SAP Note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

For more information, see the [FAQ section](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).

### Other Terms
- Xcelsius
- BI Consumer Services (BICS) WebService
- BICS Web service
- Dashboard
- Cross-domain redirection

### Reason and Prerequisites
Some pages within Xcelsius Dashboards enable a cross-domain redirection to occur. An attacker can include a URL from a different domain in a URL of the target application, which can then be sent to a user of the target application. The user thinks that the content is from the target application, but when they visit such a page, the content is delivered from the domain chosen by the attacker. The attacker can then mimic pages of the target application (for example, a logon page) to get the victim to disclose information they would not otherwise reveal to the attacker (such as their password). This can be mitigated by restricting redirections to relative or local domains only.

### Solution
The Adobe Flash Player requires that a `crossdomain.xml` file is stored on the server in the case of a Web service call from a Flash file. This `crossdomain.xml` description is used to ensure that the requesting ShockWave Flash (SWF) is also authorized to retrieve data from the server.

For the Xcelsius scenario, an appropriate `crossdomain.xml` has already been delivered in the BICS Web service deployment. This cannot be changed because it is returned by a servlet. The servlet can be accessed using the following alias:
```
http://<host>:5<instanceNr>00/bicsremotecrossdomain.xml
```
By default, `crossdomain.xml` does not need to be adjusted. If specific security settings are required for the Xcelsius dashboards, `bicsremotecrossdomain.xml` may be overwritten when an appropriate `crossdomain.xml` is created in the root of the application server.
