### Reason and Prerequisites
There are none.

### Solution
For an advanced correction, implement the source code corrections and perform the manual tasks.

**Manual Activities:**

1. **Change transaction:**
   - Call transaction SE80 and navigate to transaction `/PM0/ABC_NCSD` using the repository information system.
   - In change mode, enter the value `/PM0/CL_ABB_CD_APPLICATION` in the "Class Name" field. Save and exit the transaction.

2. **Create a message:**
   - Call transaction SE80, navigate to the package `/PM0/ABB_RELEASE5.0` and edit the message class `/PM0/ABB_START_MES`.
   - Create a new message with the following data:
     - **Message:** 001
     - **Message short text:** Transaction /PM0/ABC_NCSD is obsolete
     - **Self-explanatory:** no
   - Enter the following long text for this message:
     ```
