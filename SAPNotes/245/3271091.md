3271091 - [CVE-2022-41268] Privilege escalation vulnerability in SAP Business Planning and Consolidation

**Symptom**

**UPDATE 14th February 2023**: This note has been re-released with minor textual changes. There have not been any changes done which require customer action.

In some SAP standard roles in SAP Business Planning and Consolidation, a transaction code reserved for customers is used. By implementing such a transaction code, a malicious user may execute unauthorized transaction functionality. Under specific circumstances, a successful attack could enable an adversary to escalate their privileges to be able to read, change, or delete system data.

**Other Terms**

SAP role `SAP_BPC_ADMIN`, [CVE-2022-41268](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2022-41268)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Profile authorization can be assigned to a user incidentally.

**Solution**

Regenerate the profile of role `SAP_BPC_ADMIN` to correct the transaction code from the standard role `SAP_BPC_ADMIN`.

The role is corrected with the Support Packages mentioned in this SAP Note.
