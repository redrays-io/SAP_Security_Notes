**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 1  
**Released On:** January 24, 2014  
**Component:** Basis Components > Business Server Pages (BC-BSP)  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority

## Description

### Symptom
BSP Extensions in the **BC-BSP** package can be abused by an attacker, allowing unauthorized modification of displayed application content. This vulnerability may enable attackers to obtain authentication information from legitimate users.

### Other Terms
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- BC-BSP

### Reason and Prerequisites
BSP extensions within **BC-BSP** do not sufficiently encode output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. This can allow attackers to deface or modify web content temporarily and steal user authentication information. If an attacker impersonates an administrator, the security of the entire application may be compromised.
