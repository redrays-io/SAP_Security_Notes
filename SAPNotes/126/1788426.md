1788426 - Code Injection Vulnerability in CA-EUR (DMIS_CNT)

**SAP Security Note 1788426 Overview**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Released On:** February 12, 2013  
**Component:** Cross-Application Components > European Monetary Union - Euro (CA-EUR)  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Recency:** New  
**Language:** English  
**Version:** 2

### **Symptom**
CA-EUR (within software component DMIS_CNT) contains code that permits the execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice.

An attacker can therefore control the behavior of the system or potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code without having their own legitimate credentials.

**CVSS Information**  
- **Base Score:** 8.2  
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:C/A:C  

*Note: SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk. It does not account for your system configuration or operational environment. Conduct your own risk assessments when deciding on the applicability or priority of this security note. More information can be found in the [FAQ section](https://service.sap.com/securitynotes/).*

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The program code allows the definition and execution of user-defined code that changes the system's behavior. A valid and authenticated user is required.

Depending on the code, a user can:
- Inject and run their own code, including overwriting existing code
- Obtain additional information that should not be displayed
- Modify or delete data
- Alter the system's output
- Create new users with higher privileges
- Perform denial of service attacks

### **Solution**
Implement automatic correction instructions in all affected systems. This applies to all systems that contain the software component DMIS_CNT. You can find the correction instructions [here](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001788426/4403).
