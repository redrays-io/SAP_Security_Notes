**SAP Security Note 1786809 - Directory Traversal in PY-NO**

**Release Date:** September 10, 2013  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Component:** Payroll > Norway (PY-NO)  

### **Description**
SAP Security Note 1786809 addresses a directory traversal vulnerability in the PY-NO component. This vulnerability allows attackers to potentially read or write arbitrary files on the remote server, which could lead to data corruption or alteration of system behavior.

**Symptom:**
PY-NO fails to correctly validate file paths used to reference or write files on the remote server. An attacker can exploit this to access or overwrite arbitrary files.

### **Impact**
Exploiting this vulnerability can allow unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data corruption, or alteration of system behavior, posing significant security risks to the affected SAP systems.

### **Solution**
1. **Prerequisite:**  
   Implement the corrections from [SAP Note 1497003 - Potential directory traversals in applications](https://me.sap.com/notes/1497003).

2. **Logical File Names Configuration:**  
   - **Create Logical File Path Definitions:**  
     - `HR_NO_DIR_DOWNLOAD` (Global download directory for Norway)  
     - `HR_NO_DIR_UPLOAD` (Global upload directory for Norway)  
     Use the IMG activity "Cross-Client Maintenance of File Names and Paths" under **SAP NetWeaver → Application Server → System administration → Platform-Independent File Names** or use transaction FILE.
     
   - **Assign Physical Paths:**  
     Define physical paths corresponding to the logical file names based on your operating system to ensure secure separation of data for different users and programs.
