### Title
**1786732 - Directory traversal in J1BA**

### Description

#### Symptom
**Read-write or write directory traversal:**
J1BA contains a vulnerability through which an attacker can potentially write arbitrary files to the remote server, possibly corrupting data or altering system behavior.

#### Other Terms
Directory traversal, J1BA

#### Reason and Prerequisites
**Read-write or write directory traversal:**
J1BA fails to correctly validate the path to which a user-submitted file is written. As a result, an attacker can potentially overwrite data in the remote system.

### Solution
The solution is available with the next Support Package.  
Alternatively, you can implement the correction instruction for your release.

**Manual Activities Required:**

1. **Create the logical file paths:**
   - Go to Transaction FILE.
   - Enter the following new entries in Logical File Path Definition:
     - `FI_SPED_ECD_INPUT_PATH` - Logical Path for Input File for SPED ECD Report (Attachment)
     - `FI_SPED_ECD_OUTPUT_PATH` - Logical Path for Output File for SPED ECD Report
   - Save the entries.

2. **Create the logical file names:**
   - Still in Transaction FILE, enter the following new entries in Logical File Name Definition, Cross-Client:
     - **FI_SPED_ECD_INPUT_FILE**
       - Name: Logical File Name for SPED ECD Input File (Attachment)
       - Physical file
       - Data format: DIR
       - Applicat.area: FI
       - Logical path: FI_SPED_ECD_INPUT_PATH
     - **FI_SPED_ECD_OUTPUT_FILE**
       - Name: Logical File Name for SPED ECD Output File
       - Physical file
       - Data format: DIR
       - Applicat.area: FI
       - Logical path: FI_SPED_ECD_OUTPUT_PATH
   - Save the entries.
