**Title:** Upgrade OpenSSL to resolve the POODLE issue with the SSL 3.0 protocol

**SAP Note:** [2089135](https://me.sap.com/notes/2089135)

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** HotNews  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 11.11.2014  
**Component:** SAP Business One > System

### Description

#### Symptom
The SSL protocol 3.0, as used in many OpenSSL versions, employs nondeterministic CBC padding. This flaw makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a padding-oracle attack, known as the "POODLE" (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) issue.

#### Reason and Prerequisites
OpenSSL is a prerequisite for the following SAP Business One products:
- SAP Business One 9.0 and higher
- SAP Business One 9.0 and higher, version for SAP HANA

Due to the vulnerability in the SSL 3.0 protocol, these products are susceptible to the "POODLE" attack.

### Solution
To mitigate the POODLE vulnerability, upgrade OpenSSL on both the server and client workstations to a version that addresses the issue. The affected and fixed versions are as follows:

- **Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1j**
  - Affected: 1.0.1i, 1.0.1h, 1.0.1g, 1.0.1f, 1.0.1e, 1.0.1d, 1.0.1c, 1.0.1b, 1.0.1a, 1.0.1
- **Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.0o**
  - Affected: 1.0.0n, 1.0.0m, 1.0.0l, 1.0.0k, 1.0.0j, 1.0.0i, 1.0.0g, 1.0.0f, 1.0.0e, 1.0.0d, 1.0.0c, 1.0.0b, 1.0.0a, 1.0.0
- **Fixed in OpenSSL 0.9.8zc**
  - Affected: 0.9.8zb, 0.9.8za, 0.9.8y, 0.9.8x, 0.9.8w, 0.9.8v, 0.9.8u, 0.9.8t, 0.9.8s, 0.9.8r, 0.9.8q, 0.9.8p, 0.9.8o, 0.9.8n, 0.9.8m, 0.9.8l, 0.9.8k, 0.9.8j, 0.9.8i, 0.9.8h, 0.9.8g, 0.9.8f, 0.9.8e, 0.9.8d, 0.9.8c, 0.9.8b, 0.9.8a, 0.9.8
