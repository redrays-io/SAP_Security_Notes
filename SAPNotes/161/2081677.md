2081677 - Unauthorized modification of stored content in FIN-SEM-CPM

**Symptom**

FIN-SEM-CPM can be abused by an attacker, allowing them to modify application content, persist the modified content without authorization, and potentially obtain authentication information from other legitimate users.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Pages result in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. This vulnerability allows an attacker to permanently modify displayed content on a website, embed content that is automatically rendered without targeting victims individually, and steal another user's authentication information, such as data related to their current session. If an administrator's credentials are compromised, the security of the entire application may be fully compromised.
