- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  
- **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium (M)

- **Integrity Impact (I):** Partial (P)  
- **Availability Impact (A):** Partial (P)  

SAP provides this CVSS base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment. It is not intended to replace any risk assessments you are advised to conduct when deciding on the applicability or priority of this SAP security note.

### Reason and Prerequisites

The RFC connection maintenance does not contain authorization checks for verifying an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functions. This may result in undesired system behavior.
