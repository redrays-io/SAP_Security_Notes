SAP Security Note 2087906 - Hard-coded credentials in BC-TWB-TST-ECA

**Description**

The remote function module `ECATT_ESF_RECORDING` contains code that changes the program's behavior when a user is successfully authenticated with a certain username.

An attacker can be authenticated to use a special mode in the function module `ECATT_ESF_RECORDING`.

`ECATT_ESF_RECORDING` implements functions of the SAP test tool eCATT (BC-TWB-TST-ECA) recording feature for the Enterprise Services Framework. It can capture data about activities on ESF Business Objects within the Enterprise Service Framework. In the special mode, the captured data is displayed by the RFM as an XML document on the screen.

In affected releases, the Enterprise Service Framework is not used for processing productive data.
