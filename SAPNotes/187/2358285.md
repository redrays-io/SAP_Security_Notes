2358285 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Flash Island parts used in HCM Webdynpro applications

**Symptom**

The Flash Island files used inside the HCM WD applications (e.g., talent management and performance management) do not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impacts of XSS Vulnerability:**
- Non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website.
- Steal authentication information of the user, such as data related to their current session.
- Impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

*You are using an HCM application that includes Flash parts, for example, the talent review application in talent management or the calibration grind inside the performance management applications.*

**Solution**

*Please apply the attached correction to your system or upgrade to the corresponding support package. Then, the vulnerable `.swf` files stored in the MIME repository are replaced by safe versions.*
