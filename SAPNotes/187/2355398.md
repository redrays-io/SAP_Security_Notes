1. **Apply the Correction Instruction:**
   Implement the attached correction instruction available [here](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0002355398/14423).

2. **Update Roles:**
   Check and, if necessary, adopt your roles with the following authorization object and maintain the specified value:

   | Auth.Object | Param1     |
   |-------------|------------|
