2358849 - Whitelist based Clickjacking Framing Protection in UI theme designer on SAP Portal

**Description**

This SAP Security Note addresses a Clickjacking vulnerability in the UI theme designer on SAP Portal. The UI theme designer did not originally protect its applications against Clickjacking attacks, where an attacker tricks users into clicking on something different than intended.

**Symptom**

- UI theme designer on SAP Portal lacks protection against Clickjacking attacks.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Clickjacking is a UI-redressing attack that leverages standard HTML functionalities to deceive users into performing unintended actions. This attack type does not exploit weaknesses in the application code but rather manipulates the user interface elements.

**Solution**

SAP provides a whitelist-based framework for protecting against Clickjacking in NetWeaver technologies. This framework ensures that only trusted sources can embed the UI theme designer, mitigating the risk of Clickjacking attacks.

For a comprehensive implementation guide, refer to [SAP Note 2319727](https://me.sap.com/notes/2319727).
