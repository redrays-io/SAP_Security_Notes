## SAP Security Note 2365450 - XSS Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver SLC Sell Side Registration Page

### **Symptom**
Malicious code may be entered on the sell side and saved without an authorization check during registration. For any user opening UIs in a browser, the code may be executed if the unified rendering is not up-to-date.

**Impacts of XSS Vulnerability:**
- Non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a website
- Steal authentication information of the user, such as data relating to their current session
- Impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as the target user

### **CVSS Information**
- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 5.4 / 10
- **CVSS v3 Base Vector:**
  
  | Metric                             | Value   |

_SAP provides this CVSS v3 base score as an estimate of the risk posed by the issue reported in this note. This estimate does not take into account your own system configuration or operational environment._

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The SLC Sell Side Registration Page does not sufficiently sanitize input, resulting in a persistent cross-site scripting issue. A persistent XSS attack can store malicious code in the database, which may be executed by any user displaying the data in a browser if proper output encoding is not performed.

1. **Version Update:**
   - Please read the following Wiki on how to perform the version update: [Version Update Guide](https://me.sap.com/wiki/x/2oQCFQ)
