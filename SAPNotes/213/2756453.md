2756453 - Insufficient page protection in S/4HANA for customer management

### **Symptom**
S/4HANA for Customer Management does not sufficiently protect web browser pages from other potentially open web pages in the same browser. This exposes the system to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which can lead to:

- Defacement or modification of displayed content
- Theft of user authentication information
- Impersonation of users to access sensitive information

### **Impact**
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser session, potentially compromising the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data within the S/4HANA environment.

### **Solution**
To address this issue, implement SAP Security Note [2756453](https://me.sap.com/notes/2756453). As an immediate temporary measure before complete implementation, ensure that no servers can serve untrusted content with a host and domain name that differ only by the first segment from the host and domain name of the server hosting S/4HANA for Customer Management.

**Example:**
If your S/4HANA for Customer Management is hosted at `s4crm.zone1.mycompany.int`, ensure that:
- No other servers with the host and domain name `*.zone1.mycompany.int` serve untrusted content.
  
**Alternatively:**
Relocate S/4HANA for Customer Management to a domain and host combination that differs at the second segment from any other servers, e.g., `s4crm.protected.zone1.mycompany.int`.

### **Correction Instructions**
Delete the "Supports Portal Integration" flag in Transaction SE80 for the following BSP Applications, then save and activate the changes:

```
WAPD BSP_CAL_APP
WAPD BSP_WD_NM_SUB
WAPD CRMCMP_IC_FRAME
WAPD CRMCMP_WEBREQCR
...
```

### **CVSS Score**
- **Score:** 8.5
- **Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure that all relevant support packages are applied as specified in the SAP Note to avoid potential conflicts during implementation.
