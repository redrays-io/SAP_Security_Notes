**SAP Note Details**

- **Number:** 2756625
- **Type:** SAP Security Note
- **Version:** 4
- **Status:** Released for Customer
- **Released On:** 14.05.2019
- **Language:** English
- **Category:** Program error
- **Priority:** Correction with medium priority

**Description**

### Symptom

The read operation of an RFC destination does not consistently perform the necessary authorization checks. This omission allows for privilege escalation, enabling unauthorized access to information regarding RFC destinations on managed systems and the SAP Solution Manager system.

**Impacts of Missing Authorization Check:**
- Abuse of functionalities restricted to specific user groups.
- Unauthorized read access to restricted data.

The authorization checked is `S_RFC_ADM` with `ACTVT = '03'` (read) and `RFCDEST` using an RFC destination name. Without this check, an individual using this function module could access information about a given RFC destination on the SAP Solution Manager or any of its managed systems that they shouldn't have access to.
