SAP Security Note 2754235: [CVE-2019-0276] Inadequate Authorization Check in Banking Services

**Description**
---
**Symptom**

Smart Accounting performs an inadequate authorization check for an authenticated user, potentially resulting in escalation of privileges.

Some well-known impacts of missing authorization checks include:
- Abuse of functionality restricted to a particular user group
- Read, modify, or delete restricted data

**Reason and Prerequisites**

A check on authorization object `S_TABU_DIS` is done, and if it fails, the processing is stopped. This is too strict because an alternative check against `S_TABU_NAM` is missing.

**Solution**

Please implement the correction instructions provided in the SAP Security Note. Users who should be able to run report `/BA1/RBR_LGENT_NUMBER_RANGE` now need:
- Authorization for `S_NUMBER` for any number range
- Authorization for `S_TABU_NAM` for table `/BA1/TBR_NRSODOC`
