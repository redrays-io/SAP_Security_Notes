## Other Terms

DoS, DDoS, Distributed Denial of Service, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, Resource Exhaustion

## Reason and Prerequisites

**Reason:**  
Malformed data or unexpected data could be used to abuse application logic, deny service, or execute arbitrary code when deserialized.

These internal resources can be disclosed in the response to the request or can be used to perform a denial of service attack on the parsing system, rendering application content temporarily unavailable.

**Prerequisites:**  
You are running the Visual Composer application created in CE versions.

## Solution

When the stream is read, the class description of the serialized object appears before the object itself. The class description can be checked, and it can be decided whether to continue reading the stream.

Under the "SP Patchlevel" tab within this note, you can check for the appropriate SP Patchlevel fixing this issue.
