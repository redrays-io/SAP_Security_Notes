2407670 - Missing Authorization check in ABAP Development Tools

**Description**

ABAP Development Tools (ADT) do not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in the escalation of privileges. This vulnerability allows malicious users to execute unauthorized ABAP code, potentially leading to abuse of restricted functionalities and unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Symptom**

- ABAP Development Tools bypass necessary authorization checks.
- Escalation of privileges for authenticated users.

**Impacts of Missing Authorization Check**

- Abuse of functionalities restricted to specific user groups.
- Unauthorized reading, modification, or deletion of restricted data.

**Cause**

A user with the `S_DEVELOP` authorization is required to connect to the backend and start ABAP Development Tools. The vulnerable class implements an interface of ADT, allowing developers to execute the class from ADT without appropriate authorization checks. Consequently, a malicious user can execute unauthorized ABAP code.

**Solution**

A correction has been introduced to implement an authorization check requiring `S_DEVELOP` (OBJTYPE = CLAS, ACTVT = 16). To resolve this issue, apply the relevant Support Package mentioned in this SAP Note or follow the provided correction instructions.
