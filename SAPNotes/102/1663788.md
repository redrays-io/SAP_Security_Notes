1663788 - Unauthorized change of displayed content in CRM-IU

**SAP Security Note 1663788** addresses a critical vulnerability in the CRM-IU component of SAP Customer Relationship Management. This security issue allows malicious users to modify displayed application content without proper authorization and potentially steal authentication information from other legitimate users.

### **Symptom**
A malicious user can exploit CRM-IU to:
- Modify displayed application content without authorization.
- Obtain authentication information from other users, potentially leading to impersonation and unauthorized access.

### **Affected Components**
- **Component:** CRM-IU (Customer Relationship Management > Utilities Industry)
- **Software Components Versions:** BBPCRM 500, 600, 700, 701, 702, 712

### **Reason and Prerequisites**
The vulnerability arises because BSP (Business Server Page) pages within CRM-IU do not sufficiently encode input and output parameters. This deficiency results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which can be exploited to:
- Non-permanently deface or modify website content.
- Steal users' authentication information, leading to impersonation and potential full compromise of the application's security.

### **Solution**
To mitigate this vulnerability:
1. **Implement Corrections from Note 1582870:** Ensure that all corrections specified in SAP Note 1582870 are applied to your system before proceeding.
2. **Apply Correction Instructions:** Follow the correction instructions relevant to your specific SAP release. These instructions can be accessed [here](https://me.sap.com/corrins/0001663788/63).
