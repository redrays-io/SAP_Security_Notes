### Symptom
The Application Component CRM-MD-BP-CCP can be exploited by a malicious user to modify displayed application content without authorization. Additionally, there is potential for unauthorized access to authentication information from legitimate users.

### Other Terms
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- CRM-MD-BP-CCP

### Reason and Prerequisites
BSP Pages `view_filter_test.xsl`, `default_mob.xsl`, and `default.xsl` within the Application Component CRM-MD-BP-CCP do not adequately encode OUTPUT parameters. This deficiency leads to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Cross-site scripting can be leveraged to steal another user's authentication information, such as session-related data. A malicious user who obtains this information can impersonate the user and access all information with the same permissions. If an administrator is impersonated, the entire application's security may be compromised.
