SAP Security Note 1662714 - Unauthorized use of application functions in BC-CCM-MON

**Description**
A malicious user can execute functions in BC-CCM-MON without authentication and authorization.

**Symptom**
A malicious user can execute functions in BC-CCM-MON without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**
Cross-site request forgery, XSRF

**Reason and Prerequisites**
BC-CCM-MON executes certain functions by referencing specific URLs. When a malicious user tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a specific URL and parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the authenticated user. This can be achieved through a cross-site scripting attack or by presenting a deceptive link to the victim.

**Solution**
Please migrate to the corresponding support package. The relevant BSPs will be deleted as they are no longer used.

If you cannot update your system to the mentioned support package, you need to manually delete the affected BSP applications (this functionality isn't supported anymore and can be deleted) as follows:

1. Open transaction SE80
2. Select type: "BSP Application"
3. Enter `BSP_CCMS_AL_MINIAPP_ALVIEWER`
4. Right-click on this object and select "Delete"
5. Confirm Deletion
6. Add this deletion to a transport request
7. Repeat these steps for BSP applications `BSP_CCMS_AL_MINIAPP_ICONVIEW` and `BSP_CCMS_AL_PAGE_BUILDER`
