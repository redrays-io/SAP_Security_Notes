1511193 - XSRF protection for the CCMS Monitoring Console

---

**Symptom**

CCMS Monitoring Console is a stateful BSP application, which is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking an authenticated user's browser into making unauthorized requests.

**Reason and Prerequisites**

An attacker can execute certain functions by referencing specific URLs. By tricking an authenticated user's browser into making a request with a crafted URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the user's privileges. Additionally, the attacker may use a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack to trigger the exploit or present a deceptive link for the victim to click.

**Solution**

"XSRF Protection" has been activated for the CCMS Monitoring Console. Please import the relevant [Support Package](https://me.sap.com/supportpackage/SAPKB64027).
