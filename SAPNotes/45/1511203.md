SAP Security Note 1511203: Unauthorized Usage of Application Functionality in SAP_ABA

---

**Symptom**

A malicious user can trigger functionality in SAP_ABA without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**

Cross-Site Request Forgery, XSRF, SAP_ABA

**Reason and Prerequisites**

SAP_ABA executes certain functions through referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated userâ€™s browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the user.

If present, the attacker may use a Cross Site Scripting attack to trigger the exploit, or use an approach in which a link to click is presented to the victim.

**Solution**

The correction will be delivered with a Support Package. The relationship between the Support Package and the technical name given under "Support Packages" is described in [SAP note 1232082](https://me.sap.com/notes/1232082).

As an alternative, you can implement the correction instructions:

1. Refer to [note 1481392](https://me.sap.com/notes/1481392) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from note 1481392 are a prerequisite for the implementation of this note.

2. Implement the correction instructions of this note. This will also create the report `RH_XSRF_PARAM_SAP_ABA_ITS` in your system.

3. Execute the report and specify a corresponding transport request number when prompted. The report will add service parameters for the adapted ITS services (maintained via the GUI configuration pushbutton for a service within transaction SICF).
