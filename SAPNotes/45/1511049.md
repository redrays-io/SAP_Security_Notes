1511049 - Unauthorized usage of application functionality in IS-HER-CM

**Description**

A malicious user can trigger functionality in IS-HER-CM without authentication and authorization.

**Symptom**

A malicious user can trigger functionality in IS-HER-CM without authentication and authorization.

**Other Terms**

Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF), IS-HER-CM

**Reason and Prerequisites**

IS-HER-CM executes certain functions through referencing specific URLs. When an attacker tricks an authenticated user's browser into making a request containing a certain URL and specific parameters, the function is executed with the rights of the user.

If present, the attacker may use a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack to trigger the exploit, or use an approach in which a link to click is presented to the victim.

**Solution**

1. Refer to [Note 1481392](https://me.sap.com/notes/1481392) for additional information and instructions. The corrections from this note are a prerequisite for the implementation of this note.

2. Implement the correction instructions of this note. This will also create the report `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_PMIQ_<release>` in your system.

3. Execute the report `ITS_XSRF_PARAM_PMIQ_<release>` and specify a corresponding transport request number when prompted. The report will add service parameters for the adapted ITS services (maintained via the GUI configuration pushbutton for a service within transaction SICF).
