3046610 - [CVE-2021-27611] Code Injection vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP

### Description

**Symptom**

SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP allows a high privileged attacker to inject code by executing an ABAP report when the attacker has access to the local SAP system. The attacker could gain access to data, overwrite them, or execute a Denial of Service.

**Other Terms**

Command Injection, OS command injection, [CVE-2021-27611](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27611)

**Reason and Prerequisites**

Program `RDDPUTJR` may enable a malicious user to execute commands for which the user otherwise is not authorized.

### Solution

The program `RDDPUTJR` will be removed from the product.

- If you implement the correction instructions of this SAP Note, the code of the report is replaced by an exit statement.
- If you implement the support package mentioned in this SAP Note, the report is deleted.

**Workaround**

As a workaround, ensure that no user has authorization to execute program `RDDPUTJR` via transaction codes SA38 or SE38.

*Note that this workaround is a temporary fix and is **not** a permanent solution. SAP strongly recommends that you apply the patches outlined in the [security note](https://me.sap.com/notes/3046610), which can be done in lieu of the workaround or after the workaround is implemented.*
