3053066 - [CVE-2021-27635] Missing XML Validation in SAP NetWeaver AS for JAVA

**Description**

A malicious user authenticated as an administrator can connect over a network and submit a specially crafted XML file which can be used to attack the Java NetWeaver system under consideration. This attack can fully compromise confidentiality by allowing the attacker to read any file on the filesystem or fully compromise availability by causing the system to crash. The attack cannot be used to change any data so that there is no compromise as to integrity.

**CVSS Score:** 8.7  
**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:H

**Solution**

The XML parser is now configured securely to validate submitted XML documents so that external entities are not allowed. To protect against the attack, apply the corresponding patch.

*Note:* The Communication Profiles functionality being used cannot be separately disabled, and the XML parser cannot be configured manually; hence, no workaround is possible.
