1292875 - Security note: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in cFolders

**Symptom**

This SAP Security Note describes how to reduce the risk of possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in cFolders.

In general, all Web Servers that accept input parameters via HTTP requests, dynamically generate HTML pages based on these inputs, and then return this dynamically generated content as a response to the client (browser) are potentially vulnerable to "Cross Site Scripting" attacks.

Under some circumstances, JavaScript code can be injected with a URL as a parameter. This can cause abrupt behavior in the cFolders application on the pages `me_ov.htm` and `col_table_filter.htm`.

**Other Terms**

- Security vulnerabilities
- Cross site scripting (XSS)
