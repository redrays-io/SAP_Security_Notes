- **Version**: 3

### Symptom
This SAP Security Note addresses the risk of potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in cFolders. Web Servers that accept input parameters via HTTP requests, dynamically generate HTML pages based on these inputs, and then return the dynamically generated content as a response to the client (browser) are potentially vulnerable to XSS attacks.

Under certain circumstances, JavaScript code can be injected during the creation of a Document or Bookmark, leading to unexpected behavior in the cFolders application on the `fol_de.htm` page.

### Other Terms
- Security vulnerabilities
- Cross site scripting (XSS)
