1264767 - The subfolder parameter does not allow ".." anymore

**SAP Security Note 1264767: The subfolder parameter does not allow ".." anymore**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Category:** Program error  
**Priority:** Correction with medium priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 08.10.2009  
**Component:** EPM-BPC-MS (Enterprise Performance Management > Business Planning and Consolidation > Microsoft Version)  

**Symptom:**  
Attackers may gain access while browsing to restricted parts in the Web server directory.

**Reason and Prerequisites:**  
Attackers can access restricted parts of the Web server directory by manipulating URLs directly instead of following legitimate links. This type of attack is known as "forceful browsing."

*Example:*
```
http://localhost/OSoft/Common/ShowFile.aspx?FILE=../../../../OSoftInstall.log&TYPE=DOC
```

**Solution:**  
This issue has been corrected in BPC 5.1 SP4.  
The subfolder parameter in the file manager service has been updated to disallow the use of "..", preventing directory traversal attacks.
