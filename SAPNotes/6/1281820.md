**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Version:** 3  
**Recency:** Updated  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Help for error analysis  
**Priority:** HotNews  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** 10.12.2010  
**Component:** Basis Components > Database Interface, Database Platforms > MaxDB

### Symptom
This security note has been updated; for more details, see [security note 1524940](https://me.sap.com/notes/1524940).

A weakness in the input parameter check in WebDBM permits the infiltration of JavaScript code into your browser. This vulnerability allows access to the session cookie of an existing database administration session, which can be exploited to hijack the session.

**Note:** WebDBM is no longer supported for database administration. SAP no longer provides updates for WebDBM.

### Reason and Prerequisites
- You are using WebDBM for database administration.

### Solution

1. **Check if WebDBM is installed**
   - Use the Installation Manager (`sdbsetup`) to verify the installation:
     - Navigate to `Installation Manager` -> `Show MaxDB Components` -> `Software Components`.
   - **If WebDBM is not listed under "Software Components", it is not installed on this server, and you are not required to uninstall it.**
   - If you find WebDBM files (e.g., `webdbm.dll`, `wahttp.exe` for Windows or `webdbm.so`, `wahttp` for Unix/Linux), confirm its installation using the Installation Manager.

2. **Uninstalling WebDBM**
   - Use Installation Manager (`sdbsetup`) to uninstall WebDBM:
     - Navigate to `Installation Manager` -> `Remove MaxDB Components` -> `ODBC` -> `WebTools`.
     - Select `WebTools` and choose `FORWARD` to start the uninstallation process.
   - After successful uninstallation, delete the link from the SAP profile `DEFAULT.PFL`:
     ```plaintext
     j2ee/dbadminurl = http://<server>:9999/webdbm?Server=<server>
     ```

3. **Installing Database Studio**
   - Install Database Studio on supported platforms:
     - Windows 32-bit
     - Linux 32-bit
   - For detailed installation instructions, refer to [Note 1097311](https://me.sap.com/notes/1097311).
