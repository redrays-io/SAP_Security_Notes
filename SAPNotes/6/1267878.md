SAP Security Note 1267878 - Cross-site scripting error in BBP_POC

**Description**
You are using transaction `BBP_POC` (Create Purchase Order). On the initial screen, you choose the **Create** button. In the **Purchase Order Name** field, you then enter `"...""` (that is, a double quotation mark), for example. After you trigger any action in this transaction, the text disappears behind the double quotation mark. This may be exploited for cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Reason and Prerequisites**
This issue is caused by a program error in the template.
