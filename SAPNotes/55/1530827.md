1530827 - Login Phishing Vulnerability of AS Java

## Description

### Symptom
Prevent automatic logon with username and password within a single request.

### Other Terms
automatic logon, logon application, phishing

### Reason and Prerequisites
A phishing security vulnerability has been mitigated. Data confidentiality might be compromised because the victim might not be aware they are performing a malicious request.

### Solution
The fix can be enabled by setting the UME property `ume.logon.userpwd_automatic_logon` to `false`.

The solution is available since:
- 640 SP26
- 700 SP22
- 701 SP7
- 702 SP3
- 710 SP10
- 711 SP5
- 720 SP1
- 730 SP0
- 731 SP1

*See "SP Patch level" tab for correct patch levels.*

**Important:**  
This feature spreads over different components described in the "SP Patch level" tab. Deploying only one of them might cause problems with login.

For releases 702 and below, the global value of the property `ume.logon.userpwd_automatic_logon` needs to be modified.
