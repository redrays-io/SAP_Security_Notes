**SAP Note**: 1529849  
**Type**: SAP Security Note  
**Version**: 2  
**Recency**: New  
**Language**: English  
**Master Language**: German  
**Category**: Consulting  
**Priority**: Correction with medium priority  
**Status**: Released for Customer  
**Released On**: 11.01.2011  
**Component**: Gateway/CPIC (BC-CST-GW)

### Symptom

With Release 7.1, the gateway is delivered as part of the SCS instance for AS Java.

Without relevant security settings, unauthorized programs may be started or servers may be registered.

### Reason and Prerequisites

The gateway must have at least the following patch level as described in [Note 1298433](https://me.sap.com/notes/1298433).

- 710: 186
- 711: 73
- 720: 34

### Solution

To protect the gateway from unauthorized access, you must maintain the two ACL files `secinfo` (restarting external programs) and `reginfo` (registering RFC servers).

The files are defined by the gateway parameters `gw/sec_info` and `gw/reg_info`.

The default value is:

- `gw/sec_info = $(DIR_DATA)/secinfo$(DAT)` and/or
- `gw/reg_info = $(DIR_DATA)/reginfo$(DAT)`.

`DIR_DATA` is the instance-specific data directory  
`/usr/sap/<SID>/<INSTANCE>/data`

`$(DAT)` is the file extension (.DAT for Windows, blank for Unix).

The file `secinfo(.dat)` should contain the following line:

```
  # start of external programs disabled
```

This deactivates the starting of external programs.

The file `reginfo(.dat)` should contain the following lines:

```
  # list of java server
  TP=* HOST=local
  TP=* HOST=<host name>
  ...
  TP=* HOST=<host name>
```

In this case, each Java node should be written in the file. If the computer has several network cards, this can be added as a list. The list can be compiled with computer names, IP addresses, or IP ranges (subnets).

```
  TP=* HOST=<adr1>,<adr2>,...,<adrn>
```

As a result, only RFC server programs that run on AS Java computers can register.

You can manage the gateway with the program `gwmon`. In particular, changes to the files can be dynamically loaded subsequently (see [Note 64016](https://me.sap.com/notes/64016)) without having to restart the gateway.

In addition, see [Overview Note 1305851](https://me.sap.com/notes/1305851) that describes all known problems relating to security settings.
