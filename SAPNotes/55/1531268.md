1531268 - Potential modification of persisted data in OpenPS4MSP

**Description**

### Symptom
A malicious user can exploit OpenPS and use specially crafted inputs to modify database commands, resulting in the modification of data persisted by the system.

### Other Terms
SQL injection, database, OpenPS, OpenPS4MSP, Open Project System, Microsoft Project, MS Project.

### Reason and Prerequisites
The problem is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability. The code composes an SQL statement that contains strings that can be altered by a malicious user. The manipulated SQL statement can then be used to modify information in the database.

**Solution**

**Restrictions**
For security reasons, during logon, the system does not support a few special characters for user name and system details. Note that this restriction applies to a few characters only and does not apply to ALL special characters. To proceed with the logon, it is recommended to use alphanumeric characters.

**Recommendations**
- Review the documentation available in the combinational guide regarding installations and upgrades.
- Consult the related notes for this release, including the FAQ and Restriction Note.

**Please Note**
When uninstalling OpenPS, the system does not delete the OpenPS4MSP folder created under `Program -> Files -> SAP -> OpenPS4MSP`. It also does not delete the following files containing user information:
- **Windows XP:** `Documents and Settings -> <user name> -> OpenPS4MSP`
- **Windows Vista:** `Users -> <user name> -> OpenPS4MSP`

If these files are deleted, the user will have to reconfigure the preferences every time OpenPS is upgraded, as these folders store user preferences and options.
