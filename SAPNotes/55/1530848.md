### Description

#### Symptom
You want to better secure the communication between CRM and Lotus Domino server. Therefore you want to connect SAP CRM to the Groupware Connector via HTTPS for your Lotus Notes integration.

#### Other Terms
GWI, Groupware Connector, Lotus Notes, Lotus Domino, HTTPS, RMI

#### Reason and Prerequisites
*No additional prerequisites specified.*

#### Solution
Please follow the steps below for HTTPS enabling:

**Step 1**: Stop the SAP Groupware connector's and the Proxy service.

**Step 2**: Take a backup and replace the existing `LotusConnector.jar` present in the directories:
- `YourInstallationDirectory→Lotus→Connector→Lib`
- `YourInstallationDirectory→Lotus→Proxy→Lib`

with the `LotusConnector.jar` attached in this message.

**Step 3**: Start the services.

In addition to the steps described above, you will need to implement a certificate in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Your system administrator should assist with this, following the standard procedures for creating certificates in JVM.

The Groupware Connector communicates with the proxy via Remote Method Invocation (RMI). To further secure the communication between the Groupware Connector and the proxy, consider running the two components in a protected network area or establishing a Secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between them.
