1530983 - 'OS command injection' for external commands

**Symptom**
The SAP system allows executing OS command line calls on both local and remote application servers through transactions and ABAP functions. This functionality enables the execution of operating system commands, executable programs, and scripts with the possibility of transferring any parameter strings. While necessary for certain SAP and customer-specific applications, it introduces risks such as unauthorized or unnecessary command executions.

**Solution**
To address the security vulnerabilities associated with external commands and programs, it is crucial to implement the following SAP Notes promptly, especially if they are relevant to your system release:

- **Critical Notes to Implement Immediately:**
