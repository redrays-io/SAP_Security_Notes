SAP Security Note 1531399 - Enabling SSL for Session Protection

**Overview**

SAP Security Note **1531399** provides essential guidelines for enhancing security by enabling Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to protect sessions in your SAP landscape. This is particularly aimed at preventing session hijacking on the SAP NetWeaver Application Server (AS) ABAP. Implementing SSL ensures that all communications are encrypted, thereby maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your data.

**Solution Steps**

1. **Enable SSL for the Application Server**
   
   Follow the instructions outlined in [SAP Note 510007](https://me.sap.com/notes/510007) to set up SSL on your Application Server ABAP.

2. **Convert HTTP Requests to HTTPS Requests**
   
   To ensure all HTTP requests are securely redirected to HTTPS, you have two options:
   
   - **Form-based Authentication (Recommended)**
     
     - Navigate to Maintain Services using transaction `SICF`.
     - Select the relevant service and switch to Edit mode.
     - Go to the **Error Pages** tab.
     - Under **Logon Errors**, select the **System Logon** radio button and choose **Configuration**.
     - Define service-specific settings by entering "Switch to HTTPS" in the Protocol field.
     - Save the changes globally.

   - **ICM Configuration Trigger**
     
     While easier to implement, this method affects all access attempts, including Web services. It's suitable for Web Dynpro, BSP, etc., but not recommended if you are using Web services. For more details, refer to the [ICM/HTTP Redirect Documentation](https://me.sap.com/saphelp_nw70ehp1/helpdata/en/48/43ebd8a59c34d9e10000000a42189d/frameset.htm).

3. **Ensure the URL Generator Produces HTTPS URLs**
   
   Verify that your URL generator is configured to produce HTTPS URLs by consulting [SAP Notes 1484557](https://me.sap.com/notes/1484557) and [1503491](https://me.sap.com/notes/1503491).

4. **Set Profile Parameter for HTTPS-Only Logins**
   
   Add the following profile parameter to enforce HTTPS-only for session cookies and logon ticket cookies:
   
   ```
   login/ticket_only_by_https=1
   ```
