1531142 - Improved authorization check in function module RZL_SUBMIT

**SAP Note**: 1531142  
**Type**: SAP Security Note  
**Priority**: Correction with high priority  
**Status**: Released for Customer  
**Released On**: July 12, 2011  
**Component**: Basis Components > Computer Center Management System (CCMS) > Configuration > Workload Balancing and Group Management (BC-CCM-CNF-GRP)

**Symptom**  
The function module `RZL_SUBMIT` contains insufficient authorization checks. This module is utilized in system administration functions, such as executing system programs on the application server (e.g., in transaction `RZ03`). Currently, only administrators can execute this function, with authorization checks implemented within the function module itself.

**Solution**  
Enhance the authorization checks to restrict the use of the function exclusively to administrators (authorization object `S_RZL_ADM`). To address this issue, import the relevant support package or implement the correction instructions provided in this note.
