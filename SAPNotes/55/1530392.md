1530392 - Missing Authorization Check in SW-Delivery tools

**SAP Security Note 1530392**

**Type:** SAP Security Note  
**Priority:** Correction with high priority  
**Status:** Released for Customer  
**Released On:** February 8, 2011  
**Version:** 2  
**Language:** English  
**Category:** Program error  

### Description

**Symptom**  
An authenticated user can use functionality of the transport & SW-delivery tools to which access should be restricted. This can potentially result in an escalation of privileges. If the user has RFC authorization for these particular objects, it enables the user also to submit reports.

**Other Terms**  
Authorization, authorization check, transport & SW-delivery tools

**Reason and Prerequisites**  
SW-delivery tools lack permission checks for an authenticated user's authorization to access some of its functionality. This may result in undesired system behavior.

**Solution**  
Import the relevant Support Package or apply the SNOTE corrections. The corrections do not influence the normal functions of the application, and no further adjustments or configurations are required, since these objects contain SAP-internal functionality.
